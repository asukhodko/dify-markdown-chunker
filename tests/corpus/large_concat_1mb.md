# Debugging Data Corruption in Node.js Application

## Symptoms

- incorrect data in database
- Eventually leads to system failure
- Occurs under high load conditions

## Environment

- Node.js version: latest
- OS: Linux
- Load: 1000+ requests/second

## Code Under Investigation

```javascript
// Main application code
function processRequest(req) {
    const data = fetchData(req.id);
    const result = transformData(data);
    cache[req.id] = result;  // Potential issue here
    return result;
}
```

## Diagnostic Output

```
Memory Usage Timeline:
T+0min:  512MB
T+10min: 1.2GB
T+20min: 2.5GB
T+30min: 4.1GB (OOM kill)
```

## Heap Analysis

```
Top Memory Consumers:
Object Type      | Count  | Size
-----------------|--------|--------
CachedData       | 50000  | 2.1GB
RequestContext   | 30000  | 800MB
ConnectionPool   | 500    | 50MB
```

## Root Cause

The cache grows unbounded because there's no eviction policy.

## Solution

Implemented LRU cache with size limits:

```javascript
// Fixed implementation
const LRU = require('lru-cache');
const cache = new LRU({
    max: 1000,
    maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 5  // 5 minutes
});

function processRequest(req) {
    const data = fetchData(req.id);
    const result = transformData(data);
    cache.set(req.id, result);
    return result;
}
```

## Verification

After fix:
- Memory stable at ~600MB
- No OOM kills in 7 days
- Performance improved 20%

## Lessons

1. Always set limits on caches
2. Monitor memory usage
3. Use profiling tools early
4. Test under realistic load

# Migrating Our Infrastructure: monolith to microservices architecture

*Posted on December 06, 2025 by Engineering Team*

## Introduction

Over the past year, our platform has experienced tremendous growth. This post 
details our journey migrating monolith to microservices architecture.

## The Challenge

As our user base grew from 10K to 1M+ users, we faced several challenges:

- **Performance**: Response times increased to 2-3 seconds
- **Scalability**: Single server couldn't handle peak load
- **Reliability**: Downtime during deployments
- **Cost**: Infrastructure costs growing faster than revenue

## Initial Architecture

Our original setup:

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Client    │
└─────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  Web Server │
│  (Single)   │
└─────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  PostgreSQL │
│  (Primary)  │
└─────────────┘
```

## Solution Design

After extensive research and prototyping, we designed a new architecture:

```
┌─────────────┐
│Load Balancer│
└─────────────┘
       │
    ┌──┴──┐
    ▼     ▼
┌─────┐ ┌─────┐
│Web-1│ │Web-2│ ...
└─────┘ └─────┘
    │     │
    └──┬──┘
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   Redis     │
│   Cache     │
└─────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  PostgreSQL │
│  (Primary)  │
└─────────────┘
```

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

```bash
# Set up Kubernetes cluster
kubectl create namespace production

# Deploy Redis
helm install redis bitnami/redis \
    --set auth.password=$REDIS_PASSWORD \
    --set replica.replicaCount=3
```

### Phase 2: Application Changes

```python
# Before: Direct database queries
def get_user(user_id):
    return db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", user_id)

# After: Cache-first approach
def get_user(user_id):
    # Try cache first
    cached = redis.get(f"user:{user_id}")
    if cached:
        return json.loads(cached)
    
    # Fallback to database
    user = db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", user_id)
    
    # Cache for 5 minutes
    redis.setex(f"user:{user_id}", 300, json.dumps(user))
    
    return user
```

### Phase 3: Monitoring

```python
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram

request_count = Counter('requests_total', 'Total requests')
request_duration = Histogram('request_duration_seconds', 'Request duration')

@app.route('/api/data')
@request_duration.time()
def get_data():
    request_count.inc()
    return fetch_data()
```

## Results

### Performance Improvements

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| P50 Latency | 800ms | 95ms | -88% |
| P99 Latency | 3.2s | 250ms | -92% |
| Throughput | 100 req/s | 5000 req/s | +4900% |
| Error Rate | 2.5% | 0.1% | -96% |

### Cost Analysis

- Infrastructure cost increased by 40%
- Revenue increased by 200%
- Cost per user decreased by 50%

## Lessons Learned

1. **Measure First**: Extensive profiling revealed surprising bottlenecks
2. **Iterate Quickly**: We deployed incrementally over 3 months
3. **Monitor Everything**: Metrics were crucial for optimization
4. **Team Alignment**: Regular syncs kept everyone informed

## Challenges

### Cache Invalidation

Cache invalidation proved tricky. We implemented a pub/sub pattern:

```python
# Publisher (on data update)
def update_user(user_id, data):
    db.update("users", user_id, data)
    redis.publish('user_updates', json.dumps({
        'id': user_id,
        'action': 'update'
    }))

# Subscriber (cache invalidator)
def handle_update(message):
    data = json.loads(message)
    redis.delete(f"user:{data['id']}")
```

### Database Migration

Zero-downtime migration required careful planning:

1. Set up replication
2. Switch reads to replica
3. Migrate writes
4. Promote replica to primary

## Future Work

- Implement database sharding for further scaling
- Add CDN for static assets
- Explore serverless for batch jobs
- Improve observability with distributed tracing

## Conclusion

This project significantly improved our platform's performance and reliability.
The key was methodical planning, incremental rollout, and comprehensive monitoring.

# How to Write Technical Documentation

A comprehensive guide for creating effective markdown documentation.

## Getting Started

Technical documentation should be clear, concise, and well-structured.

## Including Code Examples

### Basic Code Blocks

Use triple backticks for simple code:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

### Showing Markdown Examples

When documenting markdown syntax itself, use quadruple backticks:

````markdown
To create a header:

# Main Title
## Subsection
### Detail Level
````

### Meta-Documentation Pattern

For tutorials about writing documentation:

`````markdown
# Documentation Best Practices

## Code Example Section

Show code with context:

````markdown
First explain the concept, then show:

```python
# Implementation
def process():
    return "result"
```
````
`````

## Real-World Tutorial Example

````markdown
# Python Tutorial: Functions

## Defining Functions

Use the `def` keyword:

```python
def greet(name):
    """Return a greeting message."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

## Calling Functions

```python
message = greet("Alice")
print(message)  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```
````

## README Template

Here's a template for README files:

`````markdown
# Project Name

## Installation

```bash
pip install project-name
```

## Quick Start

```python
import project

# Basic usage
result = project.run()
```

## Advanced Usage

For complex scenarios:

````markdown
### Custom Configuration

```python
config = {
    'option1': 'value1',
    'option2': 'value2'
}
project.run(config)
```
````
`````

## Style Guide

When creating style guides, use nested fences to show examples:

````markdown
### Code Documentation

All functions must have docstrings:

```python
def calculate(x, y):
    """
    Calculate the sum of two numbers.
    
    Args:
        x: First number
        y: Second number
    
    Returns:
        Sum of x and y
    """
    return x + y
```
````

## Conclusion

Nested fencing enables clear, unambiguous documentation about markdown syntax itself.

# Mixed Fence Types Documentation

## Overview

This document demonstrates mixing backtick and tilde fences in the same document.

## Backtick Fences Containing Tildes

When documenting tilde-based examples using backticks:

````markdown
Here's how to use tilde fences:

~~~bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Script using tilde fences"
ls -la
~~~
````

## Tilde Fences Containing Backticks

When documenting backtick-based examples using tildes:

~~~~markdown
Here's how to use backtick fences:

```python
def process_data(items):
    """Process a list of items."""
    return [item.strip() for item in items]
```
~~~~

## Real-World Use Case

A tutorial showing both fence types:

````markdown
### Option 1: Using Backticks

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

### Option 2: Using Tildes

~~~javascript
const farewell = "Goodbye!";
console.log(farewell);
~~~
````

## Alternating Examples

First example with backticks:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from Go")
}
```

Second example with tildes:

~~~rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello from Rust");
}
~~~

Both fence types work seamlessly together.

# How to Write Technical Documentation

## Including Code Examples

When documenting code, you need to show examples in markdown.

### Basic Code Block

Use triple backticks:

```markdown
Here's how to show Python:

```python
def hello():
    print('Hello, World!')
```
```

### Nested Examples

For meta-documentation:

````markdown
To show markdown within markdown:

```markdown
# Example
```python
code here
```
```
````

## Best Practices

1. Use appropriate fence depth
2. Specify language for syntax highlighting
3. Keep examples concise
4. Test all code examples

## Alternatives

You can also use tilde fences:

~~~python
def alternative():
    return True
~~~

# Tilde Fencing Guide

## Introduction

This guide demonstrates the use of tilde fencing as an alternative to backticks in markdown.

## Basic Tilde Fencing

Use triple tildes for standard code blocks:

~~~python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Call the function
result = greet("World")
print(result)
~~~

## Nested Tilde Fencing

For documentation that shows tilde-fenced examples:

~~~~markdown
To display Python code with tildes:

~~~python
def calculate_area(radius):
    import math
    return math.pi * radius ** 2
~~~
~~~~

## Mixed Content Example

Combining text and tilde-fenced code:

~~~javascript
function factorial(n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

console.log(factorial(5));  // Output: 120
~~~

The recursive approach is elegant but may cause stack overflow for large values.

# Research Notes: Database Theory Study

## Abstract

This document summarizes research findings on database theory 
optimization techniques. We investigate novel approaches and 
compare them with existing baselines.

## Literature Review

### Key Papers

1. Smith et al. (2023) - "Advanced Techniques in Database Theory"
2. Jones & Brown (2022) - "Optimization Strategies"
3. Lee et al. (2021) - "Benchmark Analysis"

### Related Work

Previous studies have shown that traditional approaches have 
limitations. Our work builds on [Smith2023] and extends it
with new methodologies.

## Methodology

### Experimental Setup

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Configuration
config = {
    'dataset_size': 10000,
    'test_split': 0.2,
    'random_seed': 42
}

# Load and prepare data
data = load_dataset(config['dataset_size'])
train, test = split_data(data, config['test_split'])
```

### Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Our Approach | Improvement |
|--------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Accuracy | 0.85 | 0.92 | +8.2% |
| Latency | 150ms | 95ms | -36.7% |
| Memory | 2GB | 1.2GB | -40% |

## Results

### Primary Findings

Our approach demonstrates significant improvements:

```python
# Results analysis
results = {
    'accuracy': 0.92,
    'precision': 0.89,
    'recall': 0.94,
    'f1_score': 0.91
}

print(f"F1 Score: {results['f1_score']:.2f}")
```

### Statistical Significance

- p-value < 0.01 for all metrics
- 95% confidence intervals shown in Table 1
- Reproducible across 10 independent runs

## Discussion

The results indicate that our approach is superior to baselines
in most scenarios. However, edge cases require further investigation.

### Limitations

1. Dataset size limited to 10K samples
2. Single domain evaluation
3. Computational cost for training

## Conclusions

This research demonstrates feasibility of the proposed approach.
Future work will address current limitations and explore
additional domains.

# Calculus and Mathematical Analysis

Essential formulas from differential and integral calculus.

## 1. Limits and Continuity

### 1.1 Definition of Limit

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L \iff \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 : 0 < |x-a| < \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - L| < \epsilon
$$

### 1.2 Important Limits

**Fundamental limits:**
$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1 - \cos x}{x^2} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^x - 1}{x} = 1
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\ln(1+x)}{x} = 1
$$

**Euler's number:**
$$
e = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n = \lim_{x \to 0} (1+x)^{1/x}
$$

### 1.3 L'Hôpital's Rule

If $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} g(x) = 0$ or $\pm\infty$:
$$
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}
$$

---

## 2. Derivatives

### 2.1 Definition

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

### 2.2 Basic Rules

**Sum rule:**
$$
(f + g)' = f' + g'
$$

**Product rule:**
$$
(fg)' = f'g + fg'
$$

**Quotient rule:**
$$
\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)' = \frac{f'g - fg'}{g^2}
$$

**Chain rule:**
$$
(f \circ g)'(x) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)
$$

### 2.3 Common Derivatives

| Function | Derivative |
|----------|------------|
| $x^n$ | $nx^{n-1}$ |
| $e^x$ | $e^x$ |
| $\ln x$ | $\frac{1}{x}$ |
| $\sin x$ | $\cos x$ |
| $\cos x$ | $-\sin x$ |
| $\tan x$ | $\sec^2 x$ |

### 2.4 Implicit Differentiation

For $F(x, y) = 0$:
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{\partial F/\partial x}{\partial F/\partial y} = -\frac{F_x}{F_y}
$$

# Machine Learning Mathematical Foundations

This document covers essential mathematical equations used in machine learning, including distance measures, loss functions, and generative model formulations.

## 1. Distance Measures

### 1.1 Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL-Divergence)

KL-Divergence measures how one probability distribution diverges from a second expected probability distribution:

$$
KL(P||Q) = \sum_{x} P(x) \log\left(\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\right)
$$

For continuous distributions:

$$
KL(P||Q) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \log\left(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\right) dx
$$

**Properties:**
- Non-negative: $KL(P||Q) \geq 0$
- Asymmetric: $KL(P||Q) \neq KL(Q||P)$
- Zero iff $P = Q$

### 1.2 Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JS-Divergence)

A symmetric version of KL-Divergence:

$$
JS(P||Q) = \frac{1}{2}KL\left(P||\frac{P+Q}{2}\right) + \frac{1}{2}KL\left(Q||\frac{P+Q}{2}\right)
$$

This is bounded: $0 \leq JS(P||Q) \leq \log 2$

### 1.3 Wasserstein Distance (Optimal Transport)

Also known as Earth Mover's Distance:

$$
W_{p}(P,Q) = \left(\inf_{J \in \mathcal{J}(P,Q)} \int ||x-y||^{p} dJ(x,y)\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}
$$

For $p=1$, this simplifies to:

$$
W_1(P,Q) = \inf_{\gamma \in \Pi(P,Q)} \mathbb{E}_{(x,y) \sim \gamma}[||x - y||]
$$

### 1.4 Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)

A kernel-based distance measure:

$$
\text{MMD}(\mathcal{F}, X, Y) := \sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \left(\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} f(x_i) - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n} f(y_j)\right)
$$

With kernel $k$:

$$
\text{MMD}^2 = \mathbb{E}[k(x,x')] - 2\mathbb{E}[k(x,y)] + \mathbb{E}[k(y,y')]
$$

### 1.5 Mahalanobis Distance

Distance accounting for correlations in the data:

$$
D_M(x, y) = \sqrt{(x-y)^T \Sigma^{-1} (x-y)}
$$

where $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix.

$$

**Optimal discriminator:**

$$
D^*(x) = \frac{p_{data}(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)}
$$

**Generator loss (non-saturating):**

$$
\mathcal{L}_G = -\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)}[\log D(G(z))]
$$

### 2.2 Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)

#### Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\theta,\phi}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}[\log p_\theta(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z}) - \log q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})]
$$

Equivalently:

$$
\log p_\theta(\mathbf{x}) \geq \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}[\log p_\theta(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z})] - D_{KL}(q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}) || p(\mathbf{z}))
$$

#### Reparameterization Trick

$$
\mathbf{z} = \boldsymbol{\mu} + \boldsymbol{\sigma} \odot \boldsymbol{\epsilon}, \quad \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)
$$

### 2.3 Diffusion Models (DDPM)

#### Forward Process

$$
q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t}x_{t-1}, \beta_t I)
$$

$$
q(x_{1:T}|x_0) = \prod_{t=1}^{T} q(x_t|x_{t-1})
$$

#### Reparameterization

$$
x_t = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t} \epsilon
$$

where $\alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t$ and $\bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{s=1}^{t} \alpha_s$

#### Reverse Process

$$
p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{0:T}) = p(\mathbf{x}_T) \prod_{t=1}^{T} p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}|\mathbf{x}_t)
$$

$$
p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}|\mathbf{x}_t) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}; \boldsymbol{\mu}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t), \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t))
$$

# Neural Network Backpropagation: A Mathematical Treatment

## Abstract

This document provides a rigorous mathematical derivation of the backpropagation algorithm for training feedforward neural networks. We cover the chain rule application, gradient computation, and common activation functions.

## 1. Introduction

Neural networks learn by adjusting weights to minimize a loss function. The backpropagation algorithm efficiently computes gradients of the loss with respect to each weight using the chain rule of calculus.

Consider a network with $L$ layers, where layer $l$ has weights $W^{(l)}$ and biases $b^{(l)}$.

## 2. Forward Propagation

### 2.1 Layer Computations

For each layer $l = 1, \ldots, L$:

**Pre-activation:**
$$
z^{(l)} = W^{(l)} a^{(l-1)} + b^{(l)}
$$

**Activation:**
$$
a^{(l)} = \sigma(z^{(l)})
$$

where $a^{(0)} = x$ (input) and $\sigma$ is the activation function.

### 2.2 Activation Functions

**Sigmoid:**
$$
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}, \quad \sigma'(z) = \sigma(z)(1 - \sigma(z))
$$

**Tanh:**
$$
\tanh(z) = \frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{e^z + e^{-z}}, \quad \tanh'(z) = 1 - \tanh^2(z)
$$

**ReLU:**
$$
\text{ReLU}(z) = \max(0, z), \quad \text{ReLU}'(z) = \begin{cases} 1 & z > 0 \\ 0 & z \leq 0 \end{cases}
$$

**Leaky ReLU:**
$$
\text{LeakyReLU}(z) = \begin{cases} z & z > 0 \\ \alpha z & z \leq 0 \end{cases}
$$

**Softmax** (for output layer):
$$
\text{softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j}}
$$

**GELU:**
$$
\text{GELU}(x) = x \cdot \Phi(x) = x \cdot \frac{1}{2}\left[1 + \text{erf}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\right]
$$

## 3. Loss Functions

### 3.1 Mean Squared Error

For regression:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{MSE} = \frac{1}{2N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}||y_i - \hat{y}_i||^2
$$

Gradient with respect to output:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{MSE}}{\partial \hat{y}} = \hat{y} - y
$$

### 3.2 Cross-Entropy Loss

For classification with softmax output:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{CE} = -\sum_{c=1}^{C} y_c \log(\hat{y}_c)
$$

Combined gradient (cross-entropy + softmax):
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{CE}}{\partial z_i} = \hat{y}_i - y_i
$$

## 4. Backpropagation Algorithm

### 4.1 Output Layer Error

Define the error signal at layer $l$:
$$
\delta^{(l)} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial z^{(l)}}
$$

For the output layer $L$:
$$
\delta^{(L)} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial a^{(L)}} \odot \sigma'(z^{(L)})
$$

### 4.2 Hidden Layer Errors

For layers $l = L-1, \ldots, 1$:
$$
\delta^{(l)} = (W^{(l+1)})^T \delta^{(l+1)} \odot \sigma'(z^{(l)})
$$

### 4.3 Gradient Computation

**Weight gradients:**
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{(l)}} = \delta^{(l)} (a^{(l-1)})^T
$$

**Bias gradients:**
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b^{(l)}} = \delta^{(l)}
$$

### 4.4 Batch Gradient

For a mini-batch of $m$ samples:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{(l)}} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} \delta_i^{(l)} (a_i^{(l-1)})^T
$$

## 5. Optimization

### 5.1 Stochastic Gradient Descent

$$
W_{t+1} = W_t - \eta \nabla_W \mathcal{L}
$$

### 5.2 Momentum

$$
v_{t+1} = \gamma v_t + \eta \nabla_W \mathcal{L}
$$

$$
W_{t+1} = W_t - v_{t+1}
$$

### 5.3 Adam Optimizer

\begin{align}
m_t &= \beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_1) g_t \\

# Debugging Data Corruption in Node.js Application

## Symptoms

- incorrect data in database
- Eventually leads to system failure
- Occurs under high load conditions

## Environment

- Node.js version: latest
- OS: Linux
- Load: 1000+ requests/second

## Code Under Investigation

```javascript
// Main application code
function processRequest(req) {
    const data = fetchData(req.id);
    const result = transformData(data);
    cache[req.id] = result;  // Potential issue here
    return result;
}
```

## Diagnostic Output

```
Memory Usage Timeline:
T+0min:  512MB
T+10min: 1.2GB
T+20min: 2.5GB
T+30min: 4.1GB (OOM kill)
```

## Heap Analysis

```
Top Memory Consumers:
Object Type      | Count  | Size
-----------------|--------|--------
CachedData       | 50000  | 2.1GB
RequestContext   | 30000  | 800MB
ConnectionPool   | 500    | 50MB
```

## Root Cause

The cache grows unbounded because there's no eviction policy.

## Solution

Implemented LRU cache with size limits:

```javascript
// Fixed implementation
const LRU = require('lru-cache');
const cache = new LRU({
    max: 1000,
    maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 5  // 5 minutes
});

function processRequest(req) {
    const data = fetchData(req.id);
    const result = transformData(data);
    cache.set(req.id, result);
    return result;
}
```

## Verification

After fix:
- Memory stable at ~600MB
- No OOM kills in 7 days
- Performance improved 20%

## Lessons

1. Always set limits on caches
2. Monitor memory usage
3. Use profiling tools early
4. Test under realistic load

# Migrating Our Infrastructure: monolith to microservices architecture

*Posted on December 06, 2025 by Engineering Team*

## Introduction

Over the past year, our platform has experienced tremendous growth. This post 
details our journey migrating monolith to microservices architecture.

## The Challenge

As our user base grew from 10K to 1M+ users, we faced several challenges:

- **Performance**: Response times increased to 2-3 seconds
- **Scalability**: Single server couldn't handle peak load
- **Reliability**: Downtime during deployments
- **Cost**: Infrastructure costs growing faster than revenue

## Initial Architecture

Our original setup:

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Client    │
└─────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  Web Server │
│  (Single)   │
└─────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  PostgreSQL │
│  (Primary)  │
└─────────────┘
```

## Solution Design

After extensive research and prototyping, we designed a new architecture:

```
┌─────────────┐
│Load Balancer│
└─────────────┘
       │
    ┌──┴──┐
    ▼     ▼
┌─────┐ ┌─────┐
│Web-1│ │Web-2│ ...
└─────┘ └─────┘
    │     │
    └──┬──┘
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   Redis     │
│   Cache     │
└─────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  PostgreSQL │
│  (Primary)  │
└─────────────┘
```

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

```bash
# Set up Kubernetes cluster
kubectl create namespace production

# Deploy Redis
helm install redis bitnami/redis \
    --set auth.password=$REDIS_PASSWORD \
    --set replica.replicaCount=3
```

### Phase 2: Application Changes

```python
# Before: Direct database queries
def get_user(user_id):
    return db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", user_id)

# After: Cache-first approach
def get_user(user_id):
    # Try cache first
    cached = redis.get(f"user:{user_id}")
    if cached:
        return json.loads(cached)
    
    # Fallback to database
    user = db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", user_id)
    
    # Cache for 5 minutes
    redis.setex(f"user:{user_id}", 300, json.dumps(user))
    
    return user
```

### Phase 3: Monitoring

```python
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram

request_count = Counter('requests_total', 'Total requests')
request_duration = Histogram('request_duration_seconds', 'Request duration')

@app.route('/api/data')
@request_duration.time()
def get_data():
    request_count.inc()
    return fetch_data()
```

## Results

### Performance Improvements

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| P50 Latency | 800ms | 95ms | -88% |
| P99 Latency | 3.2s | 250ms | -92% |
| Throughput | 100 req/s | 5000 req/s | +4900% |
| Error Rate | 2.5% | 0.1% | -96% |

### Cost Analysis

- Infrastructure cost increased by 40%
- Revenue increased by 200%
- Cost per user decreased by 50%

## Lessons Learned

1. **Measure First**: Extensive profiling revealed surprising bottlenecks
2. **Iterate Quickly**: We deployed incrementally over 3 months
3. **Monitor Everything**: Metrics were crucial for optimization
4. **Team Alignment**: Regular syncs kept everyone informed

## Challenges

### Cache Invalidation

Cache invalidation proved tricky. We implemented a pub/sub pattern:

```python
# Publisher (on data update)
def update_user(user_id, data):
    db.update("users", user_id, data)
    redis.publish('user_updates', json.dumps({
        'id': user_id,
        'action': 'update'
    }))

# Subscriber (cache invalidator)
def handle_update(message):
    data = json.loads(message)
    redis.delete(f"user:{data['id']}")
```

### Database Migration

Zero-downtime migration required careful planning:

1. Set up replication
2. Switch reads to replica
3. Migrate writes
4. Promote replica to primary

## Future Work

- Implement database sharding for further scaling
- Add CDN for static assets
- Explore serverless for batch jobs
- Improve observability with distributed tracing

## Conclusion

This project significantly improved our platform's performance and reliability.
The key was methodical planning, incremental rollout, and comprehensive monitoring.

# How to Write Technical Documentation

A comprehensive guide for creating effective markdown documentation.

## Getting Started

Technical documentation should be clear, concise, and well-structured.

## Including Code Examples

### Basic Code Blocks

Use triple backticks for simple code:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

### Showing Markdown Examples

When documenting markdown syntax itself, use quadruple backticks:

````markdown
To create a header:

# Main Title
## Subsection
### Detail Level
````

### Meta-Documentation Pattern

For tutorials about writing documentation:

`````markdown
# Documentation Best Practices

## Code Example Section

Show code with context:

````markdown
First explain the concept, then show:

```python
# Implementation
def process():
    return "result"
```
````
`````

## Real-World Tutorial Example

````markdown
# Python Tutorial: Functions

## Defining Functions

Use the `def` keyword:

```python
def greet(name):
    """Return a greeting message."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

## Calling Functions

```python
message = greet("Alice")
print(message)  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```
````

## README Template

Here's a template for README files:

`````markdown
# Project Name

## Installation

```bash
pip install project-name
```

## Quick Start

```python
import project

# Basic usage
result = project.run()
```

## Advanced Usage

For complex scenarios:

````markdown
### Custom Configuration

```python
config = {
    'option1': 'value1',
    'option2': 'value2'
}
project.run(config)
```
````
`````

## Style Guide

When creating style guides, use nested fences to show examples:

````markdown
### Code Documentation

All functions must have docstrings:

```python
def calculate(x, y):
    """
    Calculate the sum of two numbers.
    
    Args:
        x: First number
        y: Second number
    
    Returns:
        Sum of x and y
    """
    return x + y
```
````

## Conclusion

Nested fencing enables clear, unambiguous documentation about markdown syntax itself.

# Mixed Fence Types Documentation

## Overview

This document demonstrates mixing backtick and tilde fences in the same document.

## Backtick Fences Containing Tildes

When documenting tilde-based examples using backticks:

````markdown
Here's how to use tilde fences:

~~~bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Script using tilde fences"
ls -la
~~~
````

## Tilde Fences Containing Backticks

When documenting backtick-based examples using tildes:

~~~~markdown
Here's how to use backtick fences:

```python
def process_data(items):
    """Process a list of items."""
    return [item.strip() for item in items]
```
~~~~

## Real-World Use Case

A tutorial showing both fence types:

````markdown
### Option 1: Using Backticks

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

### Option 2: Using Tildes

~~~javascript
const farewell = "Goodbye!";
console.log(farewell);
~~~
````

## Alternating Examples

First example with backticks:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from Go")
}
```

Second example with tildes:

~~~rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello from Rust");
}
~~~

Both fence types work seamlessly together.

# How to Write Technical Documentation

## Including Code Examples

When documenting code, you need to show examples in markdown.

### Basic Code Block

Use triple backticks:

```markdown
Here's how to show Python:

```python
def hello():
    print('Hello, World!')
```
```

### Nested Examples

For meta-documentation:

````markdown
To show markdown within markdown:

```markdown
# Example
```python
code here
```
```
````

## Best Practices

1. Use appropriate fence depth
2. Specify language for syntax highlighting
3. Keep examples concise
4. Test all code examples

## Alternatives

You can also use tilde fences:

~~~python
def alternative():
    return True
~~~

# Tilde Fencing Guide

## Introduction

This guide demonstrates the use of tilde fencing as an alternative to backticks in markdown.

## Basic Tilde Fencing

Use triple tildes for standard code blocks:

~~~python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Call the function
result = greet("World")
print(result)
~~~

## Nested Tilde Fencing

For documentation that shows tilde-fenced examples:

~~~~markdown
To display Python code with tildes:

~~~python
def calculate_area(radius):
    import math
    return math.pi * radius ** 2
~~~
~~~~

## Mixed Content Example

Combining text and tilde-fenced code:

~~~javascript
function factorial(n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

console.log(factorial(5));  // Output: 120
~~~

The recursive approach is elegant but may cause stack overflow for large values.

# Research Notes: Database Theory Study

## Abstract

This document summarizes research findings on database theory 
optimization techniques. We investigate novel approaches and 
compare them with existing baselines.

## Literature Review

### Key Papers

1. Smith et al. (2023) - "Advanced Techniques in Database Theory"
2. Jones & Brown (2022) - "Optimization Strategies"
3. Lee et al. (2021) - "Benchmark Analysis"

### Related Work

Previous studies have shown that traditional approaches have 
limitations. Our work builds on [Smith2023] and extends it
with new methodologies.

## Methodology

### Experimental Setup

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Configuration
config = {
    'dataset_size': 10000,
    'test_split': 0.2,
    'random_seed': 42
}

# Load and prepare data
data = load_dataset(config['dataset_size'])
train, test = split_data(data, config['test_split'])
```

### Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Our Approach | Improvement |
|--------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Accuracy | 0.85 | 0.92 | +8.2% |
| Latency | 150ms | 95ms | -36.7% |
| Memory | 2GB | 1.2GB | -40% |

## Results

### Primary Findings

Our approach demonstrates significant improvements:

```python
# Results analysis
results = {
    'accuracy': 0.92,
    'precision': 0.89,
    'recall': 0.94,
    'f1_score': 0.91
}

print(f"F1 Score: {results['f1_score']:.2f}")
```

### Statistical Significance

- p-value < 0.01 for all metrics
- 95% confidence intervals shown in Table 1
- Reproducible across 10 independent runs

## Discussion

The results indicate that our approach is superior to baselines
in most scenarios. However, edge cases require further investigation.

### Limitations

1. Dataset size limited to 10K samples
2. Single domain evaluation
3. Computational cost for training

## Conclusions

This research demonstrates feasibility of the proposed approach.
Future work will address current limitations and explore
additional domains.

# Calculus and Mathematical Analysis

Essential formulas from differential and integral calculus.

## 1. Limits and Continuity

### 1.1 Definition of Limit

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L \iff \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 : 0 < |x-a| < \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - L| < \epsilon
$$

### 1.2 Important Limits

**Fundamental limits:**
$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1 - \cos x}{x^2} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^x - 1}{x} = 1
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\ln(1+x)}{x} = 1
$$

**Euler's number:**
$$
e = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n = \lim_{x \to 0} (1+x)^{1/x}
$$

### 1.3 L'Hôpital's Rule

If $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} g(x) = 0$ or $\pm\infty$:
$$
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}
$$

---

## 2. Derivatives

### 2.1 Definition

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

### 2.2 Basic Rules

**Sum rule:**
$$
(f + g)' = f' + g'
$$

**Product rule:**
$$
(fg)' = f'g + fg'
$$

**Quotient rule:**
$$
\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)' = \frac{f'g - fg'}{g^2}
$$

**Chain rule:**
$$
(f \circ g)'(x) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)
$$

### 2.3 Common Derivatives

| Function | Derivative |
|----------|------------|
| $x^n$ | $nx^{n-1}$ |
| $e^x$ | $e^x$ |
| $\ln x$ | $\frac{1}{x}$ |
| $\sin x$ | $\cos x$ |
| $\cos x$ | $-\sin x$ |
| $\tan x$ | $\sec^2 x$ |

### 2.4 Implicit Differentiation

For $F(x, y) = 0$:
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{\partial F/\partial x}{\partial F/\partial y} = -\frac{F_x}{F_y}
$$

---

## 3. Taylor Series

### 3.1 Taylor Expansion

$$
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n
$$

**Maclaurin series** (Taylor at $a=0$):
$$
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n
$$

### 3.2 Common Expansions

$$
e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!} = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots
$$

$$
\sin x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!} = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \cdots
$$

$$
\cos x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n}}{(2n)!} = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \cdots
$$

$$
\ln(1+x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1} x^n}{n} = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots
$$

### 3.3 Remainder Term

Lagrange form:
$$
R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(\xi)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}
$$

for some $\xi$ between $a$ and $x$.

---

## 4. Integration

### 4.1 Definite Integral

$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*)\Delta x
$$

### 4.2 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

**Part 1:**
$$
\frac{d}{dx}\int_a^x f(t)\,dt = f(x)
$$

**Part 2:**
$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

where $F'(x) = f(x)$

### 4.3 Integration Techniques

**Integration by parts:**
$$
\int u\,dv = uv - \int v\,du
$$

**Substitution:**
$$
\int f(g(x))g'(x)\,dx = \int f(u)\,du
$$

### 4.4 Common Integrals

$$
\int x^n \, dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C, \quad n \neq -1
$$

$$
\int e^x \, dx = e^x + C
$$

$$
\int \frac{1}{x} \, dx = \ln|x| + C
$$

$$
\int \sin x \, dx = -\cos x + C
$$

$$
\int \frac{1}{1+x^2} \, dx = \arctan x + C
$$

$$
\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \, dx = \arcsin x + C
$$

## 5. Multivariable Calculus

### 5.1 Partial Derivatives

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h, y) - f(x, y)}{h}
$$

# Machine Learning Mathematical Foundations

This document covers essential mathematical equations used in machine learning, including distance measures, loss functions, and generative model formulations.

## 1. Distance Measures

### 1.1 Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL-Divergence)

KL-Divergence measures how one probability distribution diverges from a second expected probability distribution:

$$
KL(P||Q) = \sum_{x} P(x) \log\left(\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\right)
$$

For continuous distributions:

$$
KL(P||Q) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \log\left(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\right) dx
$$

**Properties:**
- Non-negative: $KL(P||Q) \geq 0$
- Asymmetric: $KL(P||Q) \neq KL(Q||P)$
- Zero iff $P = Q$

### 1.2 Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JS-Divergence)

A symmetric version of KL-Divergence:

$$
JS(P||Q) = \frac{1}{2}KL\left(P||\frac{P+Q}{2}\right) + \frac{1}{2}KL\left(Q||\frac{P+Q}{2}\right)
$$

This is bounded: $0 \leq JS(P||Q) \leq \log 2$

### 1.3 Wasserstein Distance (Optimal Transport)

Also known as Earth Mover's Distance:

$$
W_{p}(P,Q) = \left(\inf_{J \in \mathcal{J}(P,Q)} \int ||x-y||^{p} dJ(x,y)\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}
$$

For $p=1$, this simplifies to:

$$
W_1(P,Q) = \inf_{\gamma \in \Pi(P,Q)} \mathbb{E}_{(x,y) \sim \gamma}[||x - y||]
$$

### 1.4 Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)

A kernel-based distance measure:

$$
\text{MMD}(\mathcal{F}, X, Y) := \sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \left(\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} f(x_i) - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n} f(y_j)\right)
$$

With kernel $k$:

$$
\text{MMD}^2 = \mathbb{E}[k(x,x')] - 2\mathbb{E}[k(x,y)] + \mathbb{E}[k(y,y')]
$$

### 1.5 Mahalanobis Distance

Distance accounting for correlations in the data:

$$
D_M(x, y) = \sqrt{(x-y)^T \Sigma^{-1} (x-y)}
$$

where $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix.

## 2. Generative Models

### 2.1 Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

$$
\min_G \max_D V(D,G) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}(x)}[\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)}[\log(1-D(G(z)))]
$$

**Optimal discriminator:**

$$
D^*(x) = \frac{p_{data}(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)}
$$

**Generator loss (non-saturating):**

$$
\mathcal{L}_G = -\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)}[\log D(G(z))]
$$

### 2.2 Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)

#### Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\theta,\phi}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}[\log p_\theta(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z}) - \log q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})]
$$

Equivalently:

$$
\log p_\theta(\mathbf{x}) \geq \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}[\log p_\theta(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z})] - D_{KL}(q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}) || p(\mathbf{z}))
$$

#### Reparameterization Trick

$$
\mathbf{z} = \boldsymbol{\mu} + \boldsymbol{\sigma} \odot \boldsymbol{\epsilon}, \quad \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)
$$

### 2.3 Diffusion Models (DDPM)

#### Forward Process

$$
q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t}x_{t-1}, \beta_t I)
$$

$$
q(x_{1:T}|x_0) = \prod_{t=1}^{T} q(x_t|x_{t-1})
$$

#### Reparameterization

$$
x_t = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t} \epsilon
$$

where $\alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t$ and $\bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{s=1}^{t} \alpha_s$

#### Reverse Process

$$
p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{0:T}) = p(\mathbf{x}_T) \prod_{t=1}^{T} p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}|\mathbf{x}_t)
$$

$$
p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}|\mathbf{x}_t) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}; \boldsymbol{\mu}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t), \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t))
$$

#### Training Objective

L_{simple} &= \mathbb{E}_{t, x_0, \epsilon}\left[||\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)||^2\right]
\end{align}

# Neural Network Backpropagation: A Mathematical Treatment

## Abstract

This document provides a rigorous mathematical derivation of the backpropagation algorithm for training feedforward neural networks. We cover the chain rule application, gradient computation, and common activation functions.

## 1. Introduction

Neural networks learn by adjusting weights to minimize a loss function. The backpropagation algorithm efficiently computes gradients of the loss with respect to each weight using the chain rule of calculus.

Consider a network with $L$ layers, where layer $l$ has weights $W^{(l)}$ and biases $b^{(l)}$.

## 2. Forward Propagation

### 2.1 Layer Computations

For each layer $l = 1, \ldots, L$:

**Pre-activation:**
$$
z^{(l)} = W^{(l)} a^{(l-1)} + b^{(l)}
$$

**Activation:**
$$
a^{(l)} = \sigma(z^{(l)})
$$

where $a^{(0)} = x$ (input) and $\sigma$ is the activation function.

### 2.2 Activation Functions

**Sigmoid:**
$$
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}, \quad \sigma'(z) = \sigma(z)(1 - \sigma(z))
$$

**Tanh:**
$$
\tanh(z) = \frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{e^z + e^{-z}}, \quad \tanh'(z) = 1 - \tanh^2(z)
$$

**ReLU:**
$$
\text{ReLU}(z) = \max(0, z), \quad \text{ReLU}'(z) = \begin{cases} 1 & z > 0 \\ 0 & z \leq 0 \end{cases}
$$

**Leaky ReLU:**
$$
\text{LeakyReLU}(z) = \begin{cases} z & z > 0 \\ \alpha z & z \leq 0 \end{cases}
$$

**Softmax** (for output layer):
$$
\text{softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j}}
$$

**GELU:**
$$
\text{GELU}(x) = x \cdot \Phi(x) = x \cdot \frac{1}{2}\left[1 + \text{erf}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\right]
$$

## 3. Loss Functions

### 3.1 Mean Squared Error

For regression:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{MSE} = \frac{1}{2N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}||y_i - \hat{y}_i||^2
$$

Gradient with respect to output:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{MSE}}{\partial \hat{y}} = \hat{y} - y
$$

### 3.2 Cross-Entropy Loss

For classification with softmax output:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{CE} = -\sum_{c=1}^{C} y_c \log(\hat{y}_c)
$$

Combined gradient (cross-entropy + softmax):
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{CE}}{\partial z_i} = \hat{y}_i - y_i
$$

## 4. Backpropagation Algorithm

### 4.1 Output Layer Error

Define the error signal at layer $l$:
$$
\delta^{(l)} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial z^{(l)}}
$$

For the output layer $L$:
$$
\delta^{(L)} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial a^{(L)}} \odot \sigma'(z^{(L)})
$$

### 4.2 Hidden Layer Errors

For layers $l = L-1, \ldots, 1$:
$$
\delta^{(l)} = (W^{(l+1)})^T \delta^{(l+1)} \odot \sigma'(z^{(l)})
$$

### 4.3 Gradient Computation

**Weight gradients:**
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{(l)}} = \delta^{(l)} (a^{(l-1)})^T
$$

**Bias gradients:**
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b^{(l)}} = \delta^{(l)}
$$

### 4.4 Batch Gradient

For a mini-batch of $m$ samples:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{(l)}} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} \delta_i^{(l)} (a_i^{(l-1)})^T
$$

## 5. Optimization

### 5.1 Stochastic Gradient Descent

$$
W_{t+1} = W_t - \eta \nabla_W \mathcal{L}
$$

### 5.2 Momentum

$$
v_{t+1} = \gamma v_t + \eta \nabla_W \mathcal{L}
$$

$$
W_{t+1} = W_t - v_{t+1}
$$

### 5.3 Adam Optimizer

\begin{align}
m_t &= \beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_1) g_t \\
v_t &= \beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_2) g_t^2 \\
\hat{m}_t &= \frac{m_t}{1 - \beta_1^t} \\
\hat{v}_t &= \frac{v_t}{1 - \beta_2^t} \\
W_{t+1} &= W_t - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{\hat{v}_t} + \epsilon} \hat{m}_t
\end{align}

Default hyperparameters: $\beta_1 = 0.9$, $\beta_2 = 0.999$, $\epsilon = 10^{-8}$

## 6. Regularization

### 6.1 L2 Regularization (Weight Decay)

$$
\mathcal{L}_{reg} = \mathcal{L} + \frac{\lambda}{2}\sum_l ||W^{(l)}||_F^2
$$

Gradient modification:
$$
\nabla_{W^{(l)}} \mathcal{L}_{reg} = \nabla_{W^{(l)}} \mathcal{L} + \lambda W^{(l)}
$$

### 6.2 Dropout

During training, randomly set activations to zero:
$$
\tilde{a}^{(l)} = \frac{1}{1-p} \cdot a^{(l)} \odot m^{(l)}
$$

where $m^{(l)} \sim \text{Bernoulli}(1-p)$ and $p$ is dropout rate.

### 6.3 Batch Normalization

For mini-batch $\mathcal{B} = \{x_1, \ldots, x_m\}$:

\begin{align}
\mu_\mathcal{B} &= \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i \\
\sigma_\mathcal{B}^2 &= \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(x_i - \mu_\mathcal{B})^2 \\
\hat{x}_i &= \frac{x_i - \mu_\mathcal{B}}{\sqrt{\sigma_\mathcal{B}^2 + \epsilon}} \\
y_i &= \gamma \hat{x}_i + \beta
\end{align}

$$
W \sim \mathcal{U}\left(-\sqrt{\frac{6}{n_{in} + n_{out}}}, \sqrt{\frac{6}{n_{in} + n_{out}}}\right)
$$

or with normal distribution:
$$
W \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \frac{2}{n_{in} + n_{out}}\right)
$$

$$
W \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \frac{2}{n_{in}}\right)
$$

$$

For input size $W$, kernel size $K$, padding $P$, and stride $S$:
$$
W_{out} = \left\lfloor \frac{W - K + 2P}{S} \right\rfloor + 1
$$

### 8.3 Backpropagation Through Convolution

Gradient with respect to input:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial X} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial Y} * K^{rot180}
$$

Gradient with respect to kernel:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial K} = X * \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial Y}
$$

# Debugging Data Corruption in Node.js Application

## Symptoms

- incorrect data in database
- Eventually leads to system failure
- Occurs under high load conditions

## Environment

- Node.js version: latest
- OS: Linux
- Load: 1000+ requests/second

## Code Under Investigation

```javascript
// Main application code
function processRequest(req) {
    const data = fetchData(req.id);
    const result = transformData(data);
    cache[req.id] = result;  // Potential issue here
    return result;
}
```

## Diagnostic Output

```
Memory Usage Timeline:
T+0min:  512MB
T+10min: 1.2GB
T+20min: 2.5GB
T+30min: 4.1GB (OOM kill)
```

## Heap Analysis

```
Top Memory Consumers:
Object Type      | Count  | Size
-----------------|--------|--------
CachedData       | 50000  | 2.1GB
RequestContext   | 30000  | 800MB
ConnectionPool   | 500    | 50MB
```

## Root Cause

The cache grows unbounded because there's no eviction policy.

## Solution

Implemented LRU cache with size limits:

```javascript
// Fixed implementation
const LRU = require('lru-cache');
const cache = new LRU({
    max: 1000,
    maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 5  // 5 minutes
});

function processRequest(req) {
    const data = fetchData(req.id);
    const result = transformData(data);
    cache.set(req.id, result);
    return result;
}
```

## Verification

After fix:
- Memory stable at ~600MB
- No OOM kills in 7 days
- Performance improved 20%

## Lessons

1. Always set limits on caches
2. Monitor memory usage
3. Use profiling tools early
4. Test under realistic load

# Migrating Our Infrastructure: monolith to microservices architecture

*Posted on December 06, 2025 by Engineering Team*

## Introduction

Over the past year, our platform has experienced tremendous growth. This post 
details our journey migrating monolith to microservices architecture.

## The Challenge

As our user base grew from 10K to 1M+ users, we faced several challenges:

- **Performance**: Response times increased to 2-3 seconds
- **Scalability**: Single server couldn't handle peak load
- **Reliability**: Downtime during deployments
- **Cost**: Infrastructure costs growing faster than revenue

## Initial Architecture

Our original setup:

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Client    │
└─────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  Web Server │
│  (Single)   │
└─────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  PostgreSQL │
│  (Primary)  │
└─────────────┘
```

## Solution Design

After extensive research and prototyping, we designed a new architecture:

```
┌─────────────┐
│Load Balancer│
└─────────────┘
       │
    ┌──┴──┐
    ▼     ▼
┌─────┐ ┌─────┐
│Web-1│ │Web-2│ ...
└─────┘ └─────┘
    │     │
    └──┬──┘
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   Redis     │
│   Cache     │
└─────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  PostgreSQL │
│  (Primary)  │
└─────────────┘
```

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

```bash
# Set up Kubernetes cluster
kubectl create namespace production

# Deploy Redis
helm install redis bitnami/redis \
    --set auth.password=$REDIS_PASSWORD \
    --set replica.replicaCount=3
```

### Phase 2: Application Changes

```python
# Before: Direct database queries
def get_user(user_id):
    return db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", user_id)

# After: Cache-first approach
def get_user(user_id):
    # Try cache first
    cached = redis.get(f"user:{user_id}")
    if cached:
        return json.loads(cached)
    
    # Fallback to database
    user = db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", user_id)
    
    # Cache for 5 minutes
    redis.setex(f"user:{user_id}", 300, json.dumps(user))
    
    return user
```

### Phase 3: Monitoring

```python
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram

request_count = Counter('requests_total', 'Total requests')
request_duration = Histogram('request_duration_seconds', 'Request duration')

@app.route('/api/data')
@request_duration.time()
def get_data():
    request_count.inc()
    return fetch_data()
```

## Results

### Performance Improvements

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| P50 Latency | 800ms | 95ms | -88% |
| P99 Latency | 3.2s | 250ms | -92% |
| Throughput | 100 req/s | 5000 req/s | +4900% |
| Error Rate | 2.5% | 0.1% | -96% |

### Cost Analysis

- Infrastructure cost increased by 40%
- Revenue increased by 200%
- Cost per user decreased by 50%

## Lessons Learned

1. **Measure First**: Extensive profiling revealed surprising bottlenecks
2. **Iterate Quickly**: We deployed incrementally over 3 months
3. **Monitor Everything**: Metrics were crucial for optimization
4. **Team Alignment**: Regular syncs kept everyone informed

## Challenges

### Cache Invalidation

Cache invalidation proved tricky. We implemented a pub/sub pattern:

```python
# Publisher (on data update)
def update_user(user_id, data):
    db.update("users", user_id, data)
    redis.publish('user_updates', json.dumps({
        'id': user_id,
        'action': 'update'
    }))

# Subscriber (cache invalidator)
def handle_update(message):
    data = json.loads(message)
    redis.delete(f"user:{data['id']}")
```

### Database Migration

Zero-downtime migration required careful planning:

1. Set up replication
2. Switch reads to replica
3. Migrate writes
4. Promote replica to primary

## Future Work

- Implement database sharding for further scaling
- Add CDN for static assets
- Explore serverless for batch jobs
- Improve observability with distributed tracing

## Conclusion

This project significantly improved our platform's performance and reliability.
The key was methodical planning, incremental rollout, and comprehensive monitoring.

# How to Write Technical Documentation

A comprehensive guide for creating effective markdown documentation.

## Getting Started

Technical documentation should be clear, concise, and well-structured.

## Including Code Examples

### Basic Code Blocks

Use triple backticks for simple code:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

### Showing Markdown Examples

When documenting markdown syntax itself, use quadruple backticks:

````markdown
To create a header:

# Main Title
## Subsection
### Detail Level
````

### Meta-Documentation Pattern

For tutorials about writing documentation:

`````markdown
# Documentation Best Practices

## Code Example Section

Show code with context:

````markdown
First explain the concept, then show:

```python
# Implementation
def process():
    return "result"
```
````
`````

## Real-World Tutorial Example

````markdown
# Python Tutorial: Functions

## Defining Functions

Use the `def` keyword:

```python
def greet(name):
    """Return a greeting message."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

## Calling Functions

```python
message = greet("Alice")
print(message)  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```
````

## README Template

Here's a template for README files:

`````markdown
# Project Name

## Installation

```bash
pip install project-name
```

## Quick Start

```python
import project

# Basic usage
result = project.run()
```

## Advanced Usage

For complex scenarios:

````markdown
### Custom Configuration

```python
config = {
    'option1': 'value1',
    'option2': 'value2'
}
project.run(config)
```
````
`````

## Style Guide

When creating style guides, use nested fences to show examples:

````markdown
### Code Documentation

All functions must have docstrings:

```python
def calculate(x, y):
    """
    Calculate the sum of two numbers.
    
    Args:
        x: First number
        y: Second number
    
    Returns:
        Sum of x and y
    """
    return x + y
```
````

## Conclusion

Nested fencing enables clear, unambiguous documentation about markdown syntax itself.

# Mixed Fence Types Documentation

## Overview

This document demonstrates mixing backtick and tilde fences in the same document.

## Backtick Fences Containing Tildes

When documenting tilde-based examples using backticks:

````markdown
Here's how to use tilde fences:

~~~bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Script using tilde fences"
ls -la
~~~
````

## Tilde Fences Containing Backticks

When documenting backtick-based examples using tildes:

~~~~markdown
Here's how to use backtick fences:

```python
def process_data(items):
    """Process a list of items."""
    return [item.strip() for item in items]
```
~~~~

## Real-World Use Case

A tutorial showing both fence types:

````markdown
### Option 1: Using Backticks

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

### Option 2: Using Tildes

~~~javascript
const farewell = "Goodbye!";
console.log(farewell);
~~~
````

## Alternating Examples

First example with backticks:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from Go")
}
```

Second example with tildes:

~~~rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello from Rust");
}
~~~

Both fence types work seamlessly together.

# How to Write Technical Documentation

## Including Code Examples

When documenting code, you need to show examples in markdown.

### Basic Code Block

Use triple backticks:

```markdown
Here's how to show Python:

```python
def hello():
    print('Hello, World!')
```
```

### Nested Examples

For meta-documentation:

````markdown
To show markdown within markdown:

```markdown
# Example
```python
code here
```
```
````

## Best Practices

1. Use appropriate fence depth
2. Specify language for syntax highlighting
3. Keep examples concise
4. Test all code examples

## Alternatives

You can also use tilde fences:

~~~python
def alternative():
    return True
~~~

# Tilde Fencing Guide

## Introduction

This guide demonstrates the use of tilde fencing as an alternative to backticks in markdown.

## Basic Tilde Fencing

Use triple tildes for standard code blocks:

~~~python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Call the function
result = greet("World")
print(result)
~~~

## Nested Tilde Fencing

For documentation that shows tilde-fenced examples:

~~~~markdown
To display Python code with tildes:

~~~python
def calculate_area(radius):
    import math
    return math.pi * radius ** 2
~~~
~~~~

## Mixed Content Example

Combining text and tilde-fenced code:

~~~javascript
function factorial(n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

console.log(factorial(5));  // Output: 120
~~~

The recursive approach is elegant but may cause stack overflow for large values.

# Research Notes: Database Theory Study

## Abstract

This document summarizes research findings on database theory 
optimization techniques. We investigate novel approaches and 
compare them with existing baselines.

## Literature Review

### Key Papers

1. Smith et al. (2023) - "Advanced Techniques in Database Theory"
2. Jones & Brown (2022) - "Optimization Strategies"
3. Lee et al. (2021) - "Benchmark Analysis"

### Related Work

Previous studies have shown that traditional approaches have 
limitations. Our work builds on [Smith2023] and extends it
with new methodologies.

## Methodology

### Experimental Setup

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Configuration
config = {
    'dataset_size': 10000,
    'test_split': 0.2,
    'random_seed': 42
}

# Load and prepare data
data = load_dataset(config['dataset_size'])
train, test = split_data(data, config['test_split'])
```

### Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Our Approach | Improvement |
|--------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Accuracy | 0.85 | 0.92 | +8.2% |
| Latency | 150ms | 95ms | -36.7% |
| Memory | 2GB | 1.2GB | -40% |

## Results

### Primary Findings

Our approach demonstrates significant improvements:

```python
# Results analysis
results = {
    'accuracy': 0.92,
    'precision': 0.89,
    'recall': 0.94,
    'f1_score': 0.91
}

print(f"F1 Score: {results['f1_score']:.2f}")
```

### Statistical Significance

- p-value < 0.01 for all metrics
- 95% confidence intervals shown in Table 1
- Reproducible across 10 independent runs

## Discussion

The results indicate that our approach is superior to baselines
in most scenarios. However, edge cases require further investigation.

### Limitations

1. Dataset size limited to 10K samples
2. Single domain evaluation
3. Computational cost for training

## Conclusions

This research demonstrates feasibility of the proposed approach.
Future work will address current limitations and explore
additional domains.

# Calculus and Mathematical Analysis

Essential formulas from differential and integral calculus.

## 1. Limits and Continuity

### 1.1 Definition of Limit

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L \iff \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 : 0 < |x-a| < \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - L| < \epsilon
$$

### 1.2 Important Limits

**Fundamental limits:**
$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1 - \cos x}{x^2} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^x - 1}{x} = 1
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\ln(1+x)}{x} = 1
$$

**Euler's number:**
$$
e = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n = \lim_{x \to 0} (1+x)^{1/x}
$$

### 1.3 L'Hôpital's Rule

If $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} g(x) = 0$ or $\pm\infty$:
$$
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}
$$

---

## 2. Derivatives

### 2.1 Definition

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

### 2.2 Basic Rules

**Sum rule:**
$$
(f + g)' = f' + g'
$$

**Product rule:**
$$
(fg)' = f'g + fg'
$$

**Quotient rule:**
$$
\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)' = \frac{f'g - fg'}{g^2}
$$

**Chain rule:**
$$
(f \circ g)'(x) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)
$$

### 2.3 Common Derivatives

| Function | Derivative |
|----------|------------|
| $x^n$ | $nx^{n-1}$ |
| $e^x$ | $e^x$ |
| $\ln x$ | $\frac{1}{x}$ |
| $\sin x$ | $\cos x$ |
| $\cos x$ | $-\sin x$ |
| $\tan x$ | $\sec^2 x$ |

### 2.4 Implicit Differentiation

For $F(x, y) = 0$:
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{\partial F/\partial x}{\partial F/\partial y} = -\frac{F_x}{F_y}
$$

---

## 3. Taylor Series

### 3.1 Taylor Expansion

$$
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n
$$

**Maclaurin series** (Taylor at $a=0$):
$$
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n
$$

### 3.2 Common Expansions

$$
e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!} = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots
$$

$$
\sin x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!} = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \cdots
$$

$$
\cos x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n}}{(2n)!} = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \cdots
$$

$$
\ln(1+x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1} x^n}{n} = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots
$$

### 3.3 Remainder Term

Lagrange form:
$$
R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(\xi)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}
$$

for some $\xi$ between $a$ and $x$.

---

## 4. Integration

### 4.1 Definite Integral

$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*)\Delta x
$$

### 4.2 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

**Part 1:**
$$
\frac{d}{dx}\int_a^x f(t)\,dt = f(x)
$$

**Part 2:**
$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

where $F'(x) = f(x)$

### 4.3 Integration Techniques

**Integration by parts:**
$$
\int u\,dv = uv - \int v\,du
$$

**Substitution:**
$$
\int f(g(x))g'(x)\,dx = \int f(u)\,du
$$

### 4.4 Common Integrals

$$
\int x^n \, dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C, \quad n \neq -1
$$

$$
\int e^x \, dx = e^x + C
$$

$$
\int \frac{1}{x} \, dx = \ln|x| + C
$$

$$
\int \sin x \, dx = -\cos x + C
$$

$$
\int \frac{1}{1+x^2} \, dx = \arctan x + C
$$

$$
\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \, dx = \arcsin x + C
$$

## 5. Multivariable Calculus

### 5.1 Partial Derivatives

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h, y) - f(x, y)}{h}
$$

### 5.2 Gradient

$$
\nabla f = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}, \ldots, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}\right)
$$

### 5.3 Directional Derivative

$$
D_{\mathbf{u}}f = \nabla f \cdot \mathbf{u} = |\nabla f| \cos \theta
$$

### 5.4 Chain Rule (Multivariable)

For $z = f(x, y)$ where $x = g(t)$ and $y = h(t)$:
$$
\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{dy}{dt}
$$

### 5.5 Jacobian Matrix

For $\mathbf{f}: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$:
$$
\mathbf{J} = \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_n}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### 5.6 Hessian Matrix

$$
\mathbf{H}(f) = \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1^2} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2} & \cdots \\
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2 \partial x_1} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2^2} & \cdots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots
\end{pmatrix}
$$

## 6. Vector Calculus

### 6.1 Divergence

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial z}
$$

### 6.2 Curl

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \\
F_x & F_y & F_z
\end{vmatrix}
$$

### 6.3 Laplacian

$$
\nabla^2 f = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z^2}
$$

### 6.4 Integral Theorems

**Green's Theorem:**
$$
\oint_C (P\,dx + Q\,dy) = \iint_D \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) dA
$$

**Stokes' Theorem:**
$$
\oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \iint_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot d\mathbf{S}
$$

**Divergence Theorem:**
$$
\iint_S \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = \iiint_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}) \, dV
$$

---

## 7. Differential Equations

### 7.1 First-Order Linear ODE

Form: $y' + P(x)y = Q(x)$

**Solution:**
$$
y = e^{-\int P\,dx}\left(\int Q e^{\int P\,dx}\,dx + C\right)
$$

### 7.2 Second-Order Linear ODE

Form: $ay'' + by' + cy = 0$

Characteristic equation: $ar^2 + br + c = 0$

**General solution:**
- Distinct real roots $r_1, r_2$: $y = C_1 e^{r_1 x} + C_2 e^{r_2 x}$
- Repeated root $r$: $y = (C_1 + C_2 x)e^{rx}$
- Complex roots $\alpha \pm \beta i$: $y = e^{\alpha x}(C_1 \cos\beta x + C_2 \sin\beta x)$

$$

$$
||\mathbf{x}||_\infty = \max_i |x_i| \quad \text{(Chebyshev)}
$$

### 1.3 Projections

Projection of $\mathbf{b}$ onto $\mathbf{a}$:
$$
\text{proj}_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{b} = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{||\mathbf{a}||^2}\mathbf{a}
$$

Projection onto subspace spanned by columns of $A$:
$$
\text{proj}_A \mathbf{b} = A(A^TA)^{-1}A^T\mathbf{b}
$$

# Machine Learning Mathematical Foundations

This document covers essential mathematical equations used in machine learning, including distance measures, loss functions, and generative model formulations.

## 1. Distance Measures

### 1.1 Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL-Divergence)

KL-Divergence measures how one probability distribution diverges from a second expected probability distribution:

$$
KL(P||Q) = \sum_{x} P(x) \log\left(\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\right)
$$

For continuous distributions:

$$
KL(P||Q) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \log\left(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\right) dx
$$

**Properties:**
- Non-negative: $KL(P||Q) \geq 0$
- Asymmetric: $KL(P||Q) \neq KL(Q||P)$
- Zero iff $P = Q$

### 1.2 Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JS-Divergence)

A symmetric version of KL-Divergence:

$$
JS(P||Q) = \frac{1}{2}KL\left(P||\frac{P+Q}{2}\right) + \frac{1}{2}KL\left(Q||\frac{P+Q}{2}\right)
$$

This is bounded: $0 \leq JS(P||Q) \leq \log 2$

### 1.3 Wasserstein Distance (Optimal Transport)

Also known as Earth Mover's Distance:

$$
W_{p}(P,Q) = \left(\inf_{J \in \mathcal{J}(P,Q)} \int ||x-y||^{p} dJ(x,y)\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}
$$

For $p=1$, this simplifies to:

$$
W_1(P,Q) = \inf_{\gamma \in \Pi(P,Q)} \mathbb{E}_{(x,y) \sim \gamma}[||x - y||]
$$

### 1.4 Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)

A kernel-based distance measure:

$$
\text{MMD}(\mathcal{F}, X, Y) := \sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \left(\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} f(x_i) - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n} f(y_j)\right)
$$

With kernel $k$:

$$
\text{MMD}^2 = \mathbb{E}[k(x,x')] - 2\mathbb{E}[k(x,y)] + \mathbb{E}[k(y,y')]
$$

### 1.5 Mahalanobis Distance

Distance accounting for correlations in the data:

$$
D_M(x, y) = \sqrt{(x-y)^T \Sigma^{-1} (x-y)}
$$

where $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix.

\min_G \max_D V(D,G) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}(x)}[\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)}[\log(1-D(G(z)))]
$$

**Optimal discriminator:**

$$
D^*(x) = \frac{p_{data}(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)}
$$

**Generator loss (non-saturating):**

$$
\mathcal{L}_G = -\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)}[\log D(G(z))]
$$

### 2.2 Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)

#### Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\theta,\phi}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}[\log p_\theta(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z}) - \log q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})]
$$

Equivalently:

$$
\log p_\theta(\mathbf{x}) \geq \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}[\log p_\theta(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z})] - D_{KL}(q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}) || p(\mathbf{z}))
$$

#### Reparameterization Trick

$$
\mathbf{z} = \boldsymbol{\mu} + \boldsymbol{\sigma} \odot \boldsymbol{\epsilon}, \quad \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)
$$

### 2.3 Diffusion Models (DDPM)

#### Forward Process

$$
q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t}x_{t-1}, \beta_t I)
$$

$$
q(x_{1:T}|x_0) = \prod_{t=1}^{T} q(x_t|x_{t-1})
$$

#### Reparameterization

$$
x_t = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t} \epsilon
$$

where $\alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t$ and $\bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{s=1}^{t} \alpha_s$

#### Reverse Process

$$
p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{0:T}) = p(\mathbf{x}_T) \prod_{t=1}^{T} p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}|\mathbf{x}_t)
$$

$$
p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}|\mathbf{x}_t) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}; \boldsymbol{\mu}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t), \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t))
$$

#### Training Objective

\begin{align}
L_{simple} &= \mathbb{E}_{t, x_0, \epsilon}\left[||\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)||^2\right]
\end{align}

$$

For multi-class:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{CE} = -\sum_{c=1}^{C} y_c \log(\hat{y}_c)

$$

# Neural Network Backpropagation: A Mathematical Treatment

## Abstract

This document provides a rigorous mathematical derivation of the backpropagation algorithm for training feedforward neural networks. We cover the chain rule application, gradient computation, and common activation functions.

## 1. Introduction

Neural networks learn by adjusting weights to minimize a loss function. The backpropagation algorithm efficiently computes gradients of the loss with respect to each weight using the chain rule of calculus.

Consider a network with $L$ layers, where layer $l$ has weights $W^{(l)}$ and biases $b^{(l)}$.

## 2. Forward Propagation

### 2.1 Layer Computations

For each layer $l = 1, \ldots, L$:

**Pre-activation:**
$$
z^{(l)} = W^{(l)} a^{(l-1)} + b^{(l)}
$$

**Activation:**
$$
a^{(l)} = \sigma(z^{(l)})
$$

where $a^{(0)} = x$ (input) and $\sigma$ is the activation function.

### 2.2 Activation Functions

**Sigmoid:**
$$
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}, \quad \sigma'(z) = \sigma(z)(1 - \sigma(z))
$$

**Tanh:**
$$
\tanh(z) = \frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{e^z + e^{-z}}, \quad \tanh'(z) = 1 - \tanh^2(z)
$$

**ReLU:**
$$
\text{ReLU}(z) = \max(0, z), \quad \text{ReLU}'(z) = \begin{cases} 1 & z > 0 \\ 0 & z \leq 0 \end{cases}
$$

**Leaky ReLU:**
$$
\text{LeakyReLU}(z) = \begin{cases} z & z > 0 \\ \alpha z & z \leq 0 \end{cases}
$$

**Softmax** (for output layer):
$$
\text{softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j}}
$$

**GELU:**
$$
\text{GELU}(x) = x \cdot \Phi(x) = x \cdot \frac{1}{2}\left[1 + \text{erf}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\right]
$$

## 3. Loss Functions

### 3.1 Mean Squared Error

For regression:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{MSE} = \frac{1}{2N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}||y_i - \hat{y}_i||^2
$$

Gradient with respect to output:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{MSE}}{\partial \hat{y}} = \hat{y} - y
$$

### 3.2 Cross-Entropy Loss

For classification with softmax output:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{CE} = -\sum_{c=1}^{C} y_c \log(\hat{y}_c)
$$

Combined gradient (cross-entropy + softmax):
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{CE}}{\partial z_i} = \hat{y}_i - y_i
$$

## 4. Backpropagation Algorithm

### 4.1 Output Layer Error

Define the error signal at layer $l$:
$$
\delta^{(l)} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial z^{(l)}}
$$

For the output layer $L$:
$$
\delta^{(L)} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial a^{(L)}} \odot \sigma'(z^{(L)})
$$

### 4.2 Hidden Layer Errors

For layers $l = L-1, \ldots, 1$:
$$
\delta^{(l)} = (W^{(l+1)})^T \delta^{(l+1)} \odot \sigma'(z^{(l)})
$$

### 4.3 Gradient Computation

**Weight gradients:**
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{(l)}} = \delta^{(l)} (a^{(l-1)})^T
$$

**Bias gradients:**
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b^{(l)}} = \delta^{(l)}
$$

### 4.4 Batch Gradient

For a mini-batch of $m$ samples:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{(l)}} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} \delta_i^{(l)} (a_i^{(l-1)})^T
$$

## 5. Optimization

### 5.1 Stochastic Gradient Descent

$$
W_{t+1} = W_t - \eta \nabla_W \mathcal{L}
$$

### 5.2 Momentum

$$
v_{t+1} = \gamma v_t + \eta \nabla_W \mathcal{L}
$$

$$
W_{t+1} = W_t - v_{t+1}
$$

### 5.3 Adam Optimizer

\begin{align}
m_t &= \beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_1) g_t \\
v_t &= \beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_2) g_t^2 \\
\hat{m}_t &= \frac{m_t}{1 - \beta_1^t} \\
\hat{v}_t &= \frac{v_t}{1 - \beta_2^t} \\
W_{t+1} &= W_t - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{\hat{v}_t} + \epsilon} \hat{m}_t
\end{align}

Default hyperparameters: $\beta_1 = 0.9$, $\beta_2 = 0.999$, $\epsilon = 10^{-8}$

## 6. Regularization

### 6.1 L2 Regularization (Weight Decay)

$$
\mathcal{L}_{reg} = \mathcal{L} + \frac{\lambda}{2}\sum_l ||W^{(l)}||_F^2
$$

Gradient modification:
$$
\nabla_{W^{(l)}} \mathcal{L}_{reg} = \nabla_{W^{(l)}} \mathcal{L} + \lambda W^{(l)}
$$

### 6.2 Dropout

During training, randomly set activations to zero:
$$
\tilde{a}^{(l)} = \frac{1}{1-p} \cdot a^{(l)} \odot m^{(l)}
$$

where $m^{(l)} \sim \text{Bernoulli}(1-p)$ and $p$ is dropout rate.

### 6.3 Batch Normalization

For mini-batch $\mathcal{B} = \{x_1, \ldots, x_m\}$:

\begin{align}
\mu_\mathcal{B} &= \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i \\
\sigma_\mathcal{B}^2 &= \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(x_i - \mu_\mathcal{B})^2 \\
\hat{x}_i &= \frac{x_i - \mu_\mathcal{B}}{\sqrt{\sigma_\mathcal{B}^2 + \epsilon}} \\
y_i &= \gamma \hat{x}_i + \beta
\end{align}

$$

or with normal distribution:
$$
W \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \frac{2}{n_{in} + n_{out}}\right)
$$

$$

For input size $W$, kernel size $K$, padding $P$, and stride $S$:
$$
W_{out} = \left\lfloor \frac{W - K + 2P}{S} \right\rfloor + 1
$$

### 8.3 Backpropagation Through Convolution

Gradient with respect to input:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial X} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial Y} * K^{rot180}
$$

Gradient with respect to kernel:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial K} = X * \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial Y}
$$

## 9. Recurrent Layers

### 9.1 Simple RNN

$$
h_t = \tanh(W_{hh} h_{t-1} + W_{xh} x_t + b_h)
$$

$$
y_t = W_{hy} h_t + b_y
$$

h_t &= o_t \odot \tanh(C_t) \quad \text{(hidden state)}
\end{align}

### 9.3 GRU

r_t &= \sigma(W_r \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t]) \quad \text{(reset gate)} \\
\tilde{h}_t &= \tanh(W \cdot [r_t \odot h_{t-1}, x_t]) \\
h_t &= (1 - z_t) \odot h_{t-1} + z_t \odot \tilde{h}_t
\end{align}

## 10. Attention Mechanism

### 10.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

### 10.2 Multi-Head Attention

$$
\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \ldots, \text{head}_h)W^O
$$

where:
$$
\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)
$$

## Conclusion

Backpropagation enables efficient gradient computation in neural networks by applying the chain rule systematically from output to input layers. Combined with optimization algorithms like Adam and regularization techniques, it forms the foundation of modern deep learning.

# Statistical Inference and Probability Theory

A comprehensive reference for fundamental statistical formulas and probability theory.

## 1. Descriptive Statistics

### 1.1 Measures of Central Tendency

**Arithmetic Mean:**

For discrete data:
$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
$$

For continuous data with density $f(x)$:
$$
\mu = \mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \cdot f(x) \, dx
$$

**Weighted Mean:**
$$
\bar{x}_w = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}
$$

**Geometric Mean:**
$$
\bar{x}_g = \left(\prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i\right)^{1/n} = \exp\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \ln x_i\right)
$$

### 1.2 Measures of Dispersion

**Variance:**

Population variance:
$$
\sigma^2 = \mathbb{E}[(X-\mu)^2] = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - (\mathbb{E}[X])^2
$$

Sample variance (unbiased):
$$
s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2
$$

**Standard Deviation:**
$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}, \quad s = \sqrt{s^2}
$$

**Coefficient of Variation:**
$$
CV = \frac{\sigma}{\mu} \times 100\%
$$

### 1.3 Higher Moments

**Skewness (Fisher):**
$$
\gamma_1 = \frac{\mathbb{E}[(X-\mu)^3]}{\sigma^3} = \frac{\mu_3}{\sigma^3}
$$

**Kurtosis:**
$$
\gamma_2 = \frac{\mathbb{E}[(X-\mu)^4]}{\sigma^4} - 3 = \frac{\mu_4}{\sigma^4} - 3
$$

---

## 2. Probability Distributions

### 2.1 Discrete Distributions

**Binomial Distribution:**
$$
P(X=k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
$$

where $\mathbb{E}[X] = np$ and $\text{Var}(X) = np(1-p)$

**Poisson Distribution:**
$$
P(X=k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
$$

where $\mathbb{E}[X] = \lambda$ and $\text{Var}(X) = \lambda$

**Geometric Distribution:**
$$
P(X=k) = (1-p)^{k-1} p
$$

### 2.2 Continuous Distributions

**Normal (Gaussian) Distribution:**
$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
$$

Standard normal:
$$
\phi(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-z^2/2}
$$

**Exponential Distribution:**
$$
f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, \quad x \geq 0
$$

**Chi-Square Distribution:**
$$
f(x; k) = \frac{x^{k/2-1} e^{-x/2}}{2^{k/2} \Gamma(k/2)}, \quad x > 0
$$

**Student's t-Distribution:**
$$
f(t) = \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{
u+1}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{
u\pi}\,\Gamma\left(\frac{
u}{2}\right)} \left(1 + \frac{t^2}{
u}\right)^{-\frac{
u+1}{2}}
$$

**F-Distribution:**
$$
f(x; d_1, d_2) = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{(d_1 x)^{d_1} d_2^{d_2}}{(d_1 x + d_2)^{d_1+d_2}}}}{x \cdot B\left(\frac{d_1}{2}, \frac{d_2}{2}\right)}
$$

---

## 3. Hypothesis Testing

### 3.1 Z-Test

Test statistic:
$$
z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}
$$

### 3.2 T-Test

**One-sample t-test:**
$$
t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}
$$

**Two-sample t-test (pooled variance):**
$$
t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{s_p\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}}
$$

where pooled standard deviation:
$$
s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}
$$

### 3.3 Chi-Square Test

$$
\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}
$$

### 3.4 F-Test

$$
F = \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2}
$$

## 4. Confidence Intervals

### 4.1 For Population Mean

$$
\bar{x} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

$$
\bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-1} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

### 4.2 For Population Proportion

$$
\hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}
$$

---

## 5. Regression Analysis

### 5.1 Simple Linear Regression

Model: $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon$

**Least Squares Estimators:**
$$
\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2} = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}
$$

$$
\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x}
$$

### 5.2 Coefficient of Determination

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}} = 1 - \frac{\sum(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum(y_i - \bar{y})^2}
$$

### 5.3 Multiple Linear Regression

In matrix form:
$$
\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} = (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{y}
$$

---

## 6. Correlation

### 6.1 Pearson Correlation Coefficient

$$
r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
$$

Or equivalently:
$$
r = \frac{n\sum x_i y_i - \sum x_i \sum y_i}{\sqrt{n\sum x_i^2 - (\sum x_i)^2}\sqrt{n\sum y_i^2 - (\sum y_i)^2}}
$$

### 6.2 Spearman Rank Correlation

$$
\rho = 1 - \frac{6\sum d_i^2}{n(n^2-1)}
$$

where $d_i = \text{rank}(x_i) - \text{rank}(y_i)$

---

## 7. Bayesian Statistics

### 7.1 Bayes' Theorem

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

For continuous parameters:
$$
p(\theta|x) = \frac{p(x|\theta) \cdot p(\theta)}{p(x)} = \frac{p(x|\theta) \cdot p(\theta)}{\int p(x|\theta) p(\theta) d\theta}
$$

### 7.2 Posterior Predictive Distribution

$$
p(\tilde{x}|x) = \int p(\tilde{x}|\theta) p(\theta|x) d\theta
$$

---

## 8. Maximum Likelihood Estimation

### 8.1 Likelihood Function

$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i|\theta)
$$

### 8.2 Log-Likelihood

$$
\ell(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log f(x_i|\theta)
$$

### 8.3 MLE Condition

$$
\frac{\partial \ell(\theta)}{\partial \theta} = 0
$$

### 8.4 Fisher Information

$$
I(\theta) = -\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{\partial^2 \ell(\theta)}{\partial \theta^2}\right]
$$

Cramér-Rao Lower Bound:
$$
\text{Var}(\hat{\theta}) \geq \frac{1}{n \cdot I(\theta)}
$$

    const result = transformData(data);
    cache[req.id] = result;  // Potential issue here
    return result;
}
```

## Diagnostic Output

```
Memory Usage Timeline:
T+0min:  512MB
T+10min: 1.2GB
T+20min: 2.5GB
T+30min: 4.1GB (OOM kill)
```

## Heap Analysis

```
Top Memory Consumers:
Object Type      | Count  | Size
-----------------|--------|--------
CachedData       | 50000  | 2.1GB
RequestContext   | 30000  | 800MB
ConnectionPool   | 500    | 50MB
```

## Root Cause

The cache grows unbounded because there's no eviction policy.

## Solution

Implemented LRU cache with size limits:

```javascript
// Fixed implementation
const LRU = require('lru-cache');
const cache = new LRU({
    max: 1000,
    maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 5  // 5 minutes
});

function processRequest(req) {
    const data = fetchData(req.id);
    const result = transformData(data);
    cache.set(req.id, result);
    return result;
}
```

## Verification

After fix:
- Memory stable at ~600MB
- No OOM kills in 7 days
- Performance improved 20%

## Lessons

1. Always set limits on caches
2. Monitor memory usage
3. Use profiling tools early
4. Test under realistic load

# Migrating Our Infrastructure: monolith to microservices architecture

*Posted on December 06, 2025 by Engineering Team*

## Introduction

Over the past year, our platform has experienced tremendous growth. This post 
details our journey migrating monolith to microservices architecture.

## The Challenge

As our user base grew from 10K to 1M+ users, we faced several challenges:

- **Performance**: Response times increased to 2-3 seconds
- **Scalability**: Single server couldn't handle peak load
- **Reliability**: Downtime during deployments
- **Cost**: Infrastructure costs growing faster than revenue

## Initial Architecture

Our original setup:

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Client    │
└─────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  Web Server │
│  (Single)   │
└─────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  PostgreSQL │
│  (Primary)  │
└─────────────┘
```

## Solution Design

After extensive research and prototyping, we designed a new architecture:

```
┌─────────────┐
│Load Balancer│
└─────────────┘
       │
    ┌──┴──┐
    ▼     ▼
┌─────┐ ┌─────┐
│Web-1│ │Web-2│ ...
└─────┘ └─────┘
    │     │
    └──┬──┘
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   Redis     │
│   Cache     │
└─────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  PostgreSQL │
│  (Primary)  │
└─────────────┘
```

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

```bash
# Set up Kubernetes cluster
kubectl create namespace production

# Deploy Redis
helm install redis bitnami/redis \
    --set auth.password=$REDIS_PASSWORD \
    --set replica.replicaCount=3
```

### Phase 2: Application Changes

```python
# Before: Direct database queries
def get_user(user_id):
    return db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", user_id)

# After: Cache-first approach
def get_user(user_id):
    # Try cache first
    cached = redis.get(f"user:{user_id}")
    if cached:
        return json.loads(cached)
    
    # Fallback to database
    user = db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", user_id)
    
    # Cache for 5 minutes
    redis.setex(f"user:{user_id}", 300, json.dumps(user))
    
    return user
```

### Phase 3: Monitoring

```python
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram

request_count = Counter('requests_total', 'Total requests')
request_duration = Histogram('request_duration_seconds', 'Request duration')

@app.route('/api/data')
@request_duration.time()
def get_data():
    request_count.inc()
    return fetch_data()
```

## Results

### Performance Improvements

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| P50 Latency | 800ms | 95ms | -88% |
| P99 Latency | 3.2s | 250ms | -92% |
| Throughput | 100 req/s | 5000 req/s | +4900% |
| Error Rate | 2.5% | 0.1% | -96% |

### Cost Analysis

- Infrastructure cost increased by 40%
- Revenue increased by 200%
- Cost per user decreased by 50%

## Lessons Learned

1. **Measure First**: Extensive profiling revealed surprising bottlenecks
2. **Iterate Quickly**: We deployed incrementally over 3 months
3. **Monitor Everything**: Metrics were crucial for optimization
4. **Team Alignment**: Regular syncs kept everyone informed

## Challenges

### Cache Invalidation

Cache invalidation proved tricky. We implemented a pub/sub pattern:

```python
# Publisher (on data update)
def update_user(user_id, data):
    db.update("users", user_id, data)
    redis.publish('user_updates', json.dumps({
        'id': user_id,
        'action': 'update'
    }))

# Subscriber (cache invalidator)
def handle_update(message):
    data = json.loads(message)
    redis.delete(f"user:{data['id']}")
```

### Database Migration

Zero-downtime migration required careful planning:

1. Set up replication
2. Switch reads to replica
3. Migrate writes
4. Promote replica to primary

## Future Work

- Implement database sharding for further scaling
- Add CDN for static assets
- Explore serverless for batch jobs
- Improve observability with distributed tracing

## Conclusion

This project significantly improved our platform's performance and reliability.
The key was methodical planning, incremental rollout, and comprehensive monitoring.

# How to Write Technical Documentation

A comprehensive guide for creating effective markdown documentation.

## Getting Started

Technical documentation should be clear, concise, and well-structured.

## Including Code Examples

### Basic Code Blocks

Use triple backticks for simple code:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

### Showing Markdown Examples

When documenting markdown syntax itself, use quadruple backticks:

````markdown
To create a header:

# Main Title
## Subsection
### Detail Level
````

### Meta-Documentation Pattern

For tutorials about writing documentation:

`````markdown
# Documentation Best Practices

## Code Example Section

Show code with context:

````markdown
First explain the concept, then show:

```python
# Implementation
def process():
    return "result"
```
````
`````

## Real-World Tutorial Example

````markdown
# Python Tutorial: Functions

## Defining Functions

Use the `def` keyword:

```python
def greet(name):
    """Return a greeting message."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

## Calling Functions

```python
message = greet("Alice")
print(message)  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```
````

## README Template

Here's a template for README files:

`````markdown
# Project Name

## Installation

```bash
pip install project-name
```

## Quick Start

```python
import project

# Basic usage
result = project.run()
```

## Advanced Usage

For complex scenarios:

````markdown
### Custom Configuration

```python
config = {
    'option1': 'value1',
    'option2': 'value2'
}
project.run(config)
```
````
`````

## Style Guide

When creating style guides, use nested fences to show examples:

````markdown
### Code Documentation

All functions must have docstrings:

```python
def calculate(x, y):
    """
    Calculate the sum of two numbers.
    
    Args:
        x: First number
        y: Second number
    
    Returns:
        Sum of x and y
    """
    return x + y
```
````

## Conclusion

Nested fencing enables clear, unambiguous documentation about markdown syntax itself.

# Mixed Fence Types Documentation

## Overview

This document demonstrates mixing backtick and tilde fences in the same document.

## Backtick Fences Containing Tildes

When documenting tilde-based examples using backticks:

````markdown
Here's how to use tilde fences:

~~~bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Script using tilde fences"
ls -la
~~~
````

## Tilde Fences Containing Backticks

When documenting backtick-based examples using tildes:

~~~~markdown
Here's how to use backtick fences:

```python
def process_data(items):
    """Process a list of items."""
    return [item.strip() for item in items]
```
~~~~

## Real-World Use Case

A tutorial showing both fence types:

````markdown
### Option 1: Using Backticks

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

### Option 2: Using Tildes

~~~javascript
const farewell = "Goodbye!";
console.log(farewell);
~~~
````

## Alternating Examples

First example with backticks:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from Go")
}
```

Second example with tildes:

~~~rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello from Rust");
}
~~~

Both fence types work seamlessly together.

    print('Hello, World!')
```
```

### Nested Examples

For meta-documentation:

````markdown
To show markdown within markdown:

```markdown
# Example
```python
code here
```
```
````

## Best Practices

1. Use appropriate fence depth
2. Specify language for syntax highlighting
3. Keep examples concise
4. Test all code examples

## Alternatives

You can also use tilde fences:

~~~python
def alternative():
    return True
~~~

# Tilde Fencing Guide

## Introduction

This guide demonstrates the use of tilde fencing as an alternative to backticks in markdown.

## Basic Tilde Fencing

Use triple tildes for standard code blocks:

~~~python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Call the function
result = greet("World")
print(result)
~~~

## Nested Tilde Fencing

For documentation that shows tilde-fenced examples:

~~~~markdown
To display Python code with tildes:

~~~python
def calculate_area(radius):
    import math
    return math.pi * radius ** 2
~~~
~~~~

## Mixed Content Example

Combining text and tilde-fenced code:

~~~javascript
function factorial(n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

console.log(factorial(5));  // Output: 120
~~~

The recursive approach is elegant but may cause stack overflow for large values.

# Research Notes: Database Theory Study

## Abstract

This document summarizes research findings on database theory 
optimization techniques. We investigate novel approaches and 
compare them with existing baselines.

## Literature Review

### Key Papers

1. Smith et al. (2023) - "Advanced Techniques in Database Theory"
2. Jones & Brown (2022) - "Optimization Strategies"
3. Lee et al. (2021) - "Benchmark Analysis"

### Related Work

Previous studies have shown that traditional approaches have 
limitations. Our work builds on [Smith2023] and extends it
with new methodologies.

## Methodology

### Experimental Setup

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Configuration
config = {
    'dataset_size': 10000,
    'test_split': 0.2,
    'random_seed': 42
}

# Load and prepare data
data = load_dataset(config['dataset_size'])
train, test = split_data(data, config['test_split'])
```

### Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Our Approach | Improvement |
|--------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Accuracy | 0.85 | 0.92 | +8.2% |
| Latency | 150ms | 95ms | -36.7% |
| Memory | 2GB | 1.2GB | -40% |

## Results

### Primary Findings

Our approach demonstrates significant improvements:

```python
# Results analysis
results = {
    'accuracy': 0.92,
    'precision': 0.89,
    'recall': 0.94,
    'f1_score': 0.91
}

print(f"F1 Score: {results['f1_score']:.2f}")
```

### Statistical Significance

- p-value < 0.01 for all metrics
- 95% confidence intervals shown in Table 1
- Reproducible across 10 independent runs

## Discussion

The results indicate that our approach is superior to baselines
in most scenarios. However, edge cases require further investigation.

### Limitations

1. Dataset size limited to 10K samples
2. Single domain evaluation
3. Computational cost for training

## Conclusions

This research demonstrates feasibility of the proposed approach.
Future work will address current limitations and explore
additional domains.

# Calculus and Mathematical Analysis

Essential formulas from differential and integral calculus.

## 1. Limits and Continuity

### 1.1 Definition of Limit

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L \iff \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 : 0 < |x-a| < \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - L| < \epsilon
$$

### 1.2 Important Limits

**Fundamental limits:**
$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1 - \cos x}{x^2} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^x - 1}{x} = 1
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\ln(1+x)}{x} = 1
$$

**Euler's number:**
$$
e = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n = \lim_{x \to 0} (1+x)^{1/x}
$$

### 1.3 L'Hôpital's Rule

If $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} g(x) = 0$ or $\pm\infty$:
$$
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}
$$

---

## 2. Derivatives

### 2.1 Definition

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

### 2.2 Basic Rules

**Sum rule:**
$$
(f + g)' = f' + g'
$$

**Product rule:**
$$
(fg)' = f'g + fg'
$$

**Quotient rule:**
$$
\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)' = \frac{f'g - fg'}{g^2}
$$

**Chain rule:**
$$
(f \circ g)'(x) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)
$$

### 2.3 Common Derivatives

| Function | Derivative |
|----------|------------|
| $x^n$ | $nx^{n-1}$ |
| $e^x$ | $e^x$ |
| $\ln x$ | $\frac{1}{x}$ |
| $\sin x$ | $\cos x$ |
| $\cos x$ | $-\sin x$ |
| $\tan x$ | $\sec^2 x$ |

### 2.4 Implicit Differentiation

For $F(x, y) = 0$:
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{\partial F/\partial x}{\partial F/\partial y} = -\frac{F_x}{F_y}
$$

---

## 3. Taylor Series

### 3.1 Taylor Expansion

$$
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n
$$

**Maclaurin series** (Taylor at $a=0$):
$$
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n
$$

### 3.2 Common Expansions

$$
e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!} = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots
$$

$$
\sin x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!} = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \cdots
$$

$$
\cos x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n}}{(2n)!} = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \cdots
$$

$$
\ln(1+x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1} x^n}{n} = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots
$$

### 3.3 Remainder Term

Lagrange form:
$$
R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(\xi)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}
$$

for some $\xi$ between $a$ and $x$.

## 4. Integration

### 4.1 Definite Integral

$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*)\Delta x
$$

### 4.2 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

**Part 1:**
$$
\frac{d}{dx}\int_a^x f(t)\,dt = f(x)
$$

**Part 2:**
$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

where $F'(x) = f(x)$

### 4.3 Integration Techniques

**Integration by parts:**
$$
\int u\,dv = uv - \int v\,du
$$

**Substitution:**
$$
\int f(g(x))g'(x)\,dx = \int f(u)\,du
$$

### 4.4 Common Integrals

$$
\int x^n \, dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C, \quad n \neq -1
$$

$$
\int e^x \, dx = e^x + C
$$

$$
\int \frac{1}{x} \, dx = \ln|x| + C
$$

$$
\int \sin x \, dx = -\cos x + C
$$

$$
\int \frac{1}{1+x^2} \, dx = \arctan x + C
$$

$$
\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \, dx = \arcsin x + C
$$

## 5. Multivariable Calculus

### 5.1 Partial Derivatives

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h, y) - f(x, y)}{h}
$$

### 5.2 Gradient

$$
\nabla f = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}, \ldots, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}\right)
$$

### 5.3 Directional Derivative

$$
D_{\mathbf{u}}f = \nabla f \cdot \mathbf{u} = |\nabla f| \cos \theta
$$

### 5.4 Chain Rule (Multivariable)

For $z = f(x, y)$ where $x = g(t)$ and $y = h(t)$:
$$
\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{dy}{dt}
$$

### 5.5 Jacobian Matrix

For $\mathbf{f}: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$:
$$
\mathbf{J} = \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_n}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### 5.6 Hessian Matrix

$$
\mathbf{H}(f) = \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1^2} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2} & \cdots \\
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2 \partial x_1} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2^2} & \cdots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots
\end{pmatrix}
$$

\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial z}
$$

### 6.2 Curl

\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \\
F_x & F_y & F_z
\end{vmatrix}
$$

### 6.3 Laplacian

$$
\nabla^2 f = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z^2}
$$

### 6.4 Integral Theorems

**Green's Theorem:**
$$
\oint_C (P\,dx + Q\,dy) = \iint_D \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) dA
$$

**Stokes' Theorem:**
$$
\oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \iint_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot d\mathbf{S}
$$

**Divergence Theorem:**
$$
\iint_S \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = \iiint_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}) \, dV
$$

$$
y = e^{-\int P\,dx}\left(\int Q e^{\int P\,dx}\,dx + C\right)
$$

### 7.2 Second-Order Linear ODE

Form: $ay'' + by' + cy = 0$

Characteristic equation: $ar^2 + br + c = 0$

**General solution:**
- Distinct real roots $r_1, r_2$: $y = C_1 e^{r_1 x} + C_2 e^{r_2 x}$
- Repeated root $r$: $y = (C_1 + C_2 x)e^{rx}$
- Complex roots $\alpha \pm \beta i$: $y = e^{\alpha x}(C_1 \cos\beta x + C_2 \sin\beta x)$

Projection of $\mathbf{b}$ onto $\mathbf{a}$:
$$
\text{proj}_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{b} = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{||\mathbf{a}||^2}\mathbf{a}
$$

Projection onto subspace spanned by columns of $A$:
$$
\text{proj}_A \mathbf{b} = A(A^TA)^{-1}A^T\mathbf{b}
$$

$$

**Diagonal matrix:**
$$
D = \text{diag}(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n)
$$

**Symmetric:** $A = A^T$

**Orthogonal:** $Q^TQ = QQ^T = I$

**Positive definite:** $\mathbf{x}^T A \mathbf{x} > 0$ for all $\mathbf{x} \neq 0$

### 2.3 Matrix Norms

**Frobenius norm:**
$$
||A||_F = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n} |a_{ij}|^2} = \sqrt{\text{tr}(A^T A)}
$$

**Spectral norm:**

### 3.1 Determinant Properties

$$
\det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B)
$$

$$
\det(A^{-1}) = \frac{1}{\det(A)}

# Machine Learning Mathematical Foundations

This document covers essential mathematical equations used in machine learning, including distance measures, loss functions, and generative model formulations.

## 1. Distance Measures

### 1.1 Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL-Divergence)

KL-Divergence measures how one probability distribution diverges from a second expected probability distribution:

$$
KL(P||Q) = \sum_{x} P(x) \log\left(\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\right)
$$

For continuous distributions:

$$
KL(P||Q) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \log\left(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\right) dx
$$

**Properties:**
- Non-negative: $KL(P||Q) \geq 0$
- Asymmetric: $KL(P||Q) \neq KL(Q||P)$
- Zero iff $P = Q$

### 1.2 Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JS-Divergence)

A symmetric version of KL-Divergence:

$$
JS(P||Q) = \frac{1}{2}KL\left(P||\frac{P+Q}{2}\right) + \frac{1}{2}KL\left(Q||\frac{P+Q}{2}\right)
$$

This is bounded: $0 \leq JS(P||Q) \leq \log 2$

### 1.3 Wasserstein Distance (Optimal Transport)

Also known as Earth Mover's Distance:

$$
W_{p}(P,Q) = \left(\inf_{J \in \mathcal{J}(P,Q)} \int ||x-y||^{p} dJ(x,y)\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}
$$

For $p=1$, this simplifies to:

$$
W_1(P,Q) = \inf_{\gamma \in \Pi(P,Q)} \mathbb{E}_{(x,y) \sim \gamma}[||x - y||]
$$

### 1.4 Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)

A kernel-based distance measure:

$$
\text{MMD}(\mathcal{F}, X, Y) := \sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \left(\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} f(x_i) - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n} f(y_j)\right)
$$

With kernel $k$:

$$
\text{MMD}^2 = \mathbb{E}[k(x,x')] - 2\mathbb{E}[k(x,y)] + \mathbb{E}[k(y,y')]
$$

### 1.5 Mahalanobis Distance

Distance accounting for correlations in the data:

$$
D_M(x, y) = \sqrt{(x-y)^T \Sigma^{-1} (x-y)}
$$

where $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix.

$$

**Optimal discriminator:**

$$
D^*(x) = \frac{p_{data}(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)}
$$

**Generator loss (non-saturating):**

$$
\mathcal{L}_G = -\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)}[\log D(G(z))]
$$

### 2.2 Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)

#### Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\theta,\phi}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}[\log p_\theta(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z}) - \log q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})]
$$

Equivalently:

$$
\log p_\theta(\mathbf{x}) \geq \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}[\log p_\theta(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z})] - D_{KL}(q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}) || p(\mathbf{z}))
$$

#### Reparameterization Trick

$$
\mathbf{z} = \boldsymbol{\mu} + \boldsymbol{\sigma} \odot \boldsymbol{\epsilon}, \quad \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)
$$

### 2.3 Diffusion Models (DDPM)

#### Forward Process

$$
q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t}x_{t-1}, \beta_t I)
$$

$$
q(x_{1:T}|x_0) = \prod_{t=1}^{T} q(x_t|x_{t-1})
$$

#### Reparameterization

$$
x_t = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t} \epsilon
$$

where $\alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t$ and $\bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{s=1}^{t} \alpha_s$

#### Reverse Process

$$
p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{0:T}) = p(\mathbf{x}_T) \prod_{t=1}^{T} p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}|\mathbf{x}_t)
$$

$$
p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}|\mathbf{x}_t) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}; \boldsymbol{\mu}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t), \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t))
$$

#### Training Objective

\begin{align}
L_{simple} &= \mathbb{E}_{t, x_0, \epsilon}\left[||\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)||^2\right]
\end{align}

$$

For multi-class:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{CE} = -\sum_{c=1}^{C} y_c \log(\hat{y}_c)

# Neural Network Backpropagation: A Mathematical Treatment

## Abstract

This document provides a rigorous mathematical derivation of the backpropagation algorithm for training feedforward neural networks. We cover the chain rule application, gradient computation, and common activation functions.

## 1. Introduction

Neural networks learn by adjusting weights to minimize a loss function. The backpropagation algorithm efficiently computes gradients of the loss with respect to each weight using the chain rule of calculus.

Consider a network with $L$ layers, where layer $l$ has weights $W^{(l)}$ and biases $b^{(l)}$.

## 2. Forward Propagation

### 2.1 Layer Computations

For each layer $l = 1, \ldots, L$:

**Pre-activation:**
$$
z^{(l)} = W^{(l)} a^{(l-1)} + b^{(l)}
$$

**Activation:**
$$
a^{(l)} = \sigma(z^{(l)})
$$

where $a^{(0)} = x$ (input) and $\sigma$ is the activation function.

### 2.2 Activation Functions

**Sigmoid:**
$$
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}, \quad \sigma'(z) = \sigma(z)(1 - \sigma(z))
$$

**Tanh:**
$$
\tanh(z) = \frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{e^z + e^{-z}}, \quad \tanh'(z) = 1 - \tanh^2(z)
$$

**ReLU:**
$$
\text{ReLU}(z) = \max(0, z), \quad \text{ReLU}'(z) = \begin{cases} 1 & z > 0 \\ 0 & z \leq 0 \end{cases}
$$

**Leaky ReLU:**
$$
\text{LeakyReLU}(z) = \begin{cases} z & z > 0 \\ \alpha z & z \leq 0 \end{cases}
$$

**Softmax** (for output layer):
$$
\text{softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j}}
$$

**GELU:**
$$
\text{GELU}(x) = x \cdot \Phi(x) = x \cdot \frac{1}{2}\left[1 + \text{erf}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\right]
$$

## 3. Loss Functions

### 3.1 Mean Squared Error

For regression:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{MSE} = \frac{1}{2N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}||y_i - \hat{y}_i||^2
$$

Gradient with respect to output:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{MSE}}{\partial \hat{y}} = \hat{y} - y
$$

### 3.2 Cross-Entropy Loss

For classification with softmax output:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{CE} = -\sum_{c=1}^{C} y_c \log(\hat{y}_c)
$$

Combined gradient (cross-entropy + softmax):
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{CE}}{\partial z_i} = \hat{y}_i - y_i
$$

## 4. Backpropagation Algorithm

### 4.1 Output Layer Error

Define the error signal at layer $l$:
$$
\delta^{(l)} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial z^{(l)}}
$$

For the output layer $L$:
$$
\delta^{(L)} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial a^{(L)}} \odot \sigma'(z^{(L)})
$$

### 4.2 Hidden Layer Errors

For layers $l = L-1, \ldots, 1$:
$$
\delta^{(l)} = (W^{(l+1)})^T \delta^{(l+1)} \odot \sigma'(z^{(l)})
$$

### 4.3 Gradient Computation

**Weight gradients:**
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{(l)}} = \delta^{(l)} (a^{(l-1)})^T
$$

**Bias gradients:**
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b^{(l)}} = \delta^{(l)}
$$

### 4.4 Batch Gradient

For a mini-batch of $m$ samples:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{(l)}} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} \delta_i^{(l)} (a_i^{(l-1)})^T
$$

## 5. Optimization

### 5.1 Stochastic Gradient Descent

$$
W_{t+1} = W_t - \eta \nabla_W \mathcal{L}
$$

### 5.2 Momentum

$$
v_{t+1} = \gamma v_t + \eta \nabla_W \mathcal{L}
$$

$$
W_{t+1} = W_t - v_{t+1}
$$

### 5.3 Adam Optimizer

\begin{align}
m_t &= \beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_1) g_t \\
v_t &= \beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_2) g_t^2 \\
\hat{m}_t &= \frac{m_t}{1 - \beta_1^t} \\
\hat{v}_t &= \frac{v_t}{1 - \beta_2^t} \\
W_{t+1} &= W_t - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{\hat{v}_t} + \epsilon} \hat{m}_t
\end{align}

Default hyperparameters: $\beta_1 = 0.9$, $\beta_2 = 0.999$, $\epsilon = 10^{-8}$

## 6. Regularization

### 6.1 L2 Regularization (Weight Decay)

$$
\mathcal{L}_{reg} = \mathcal{L} + \frac{\lambda}{2}\sum_l ||W^{(l)}||_F^2
$$

Gradient modification:
$$
\nabla_{W^{(l)}} \mathcal{L}_{reg} = \nabla_{W^{(l)}} \mathcal{L} + \lambda W^{(l)}
$$

### 6.2 Dropout

During training, randomly set activations to zero:
$$
\tilde{a}^{(l)} = \frac{1}{1-p} \cdot a^{(l)} \odot m^{(l)}
$$

where $m^{(l)} \sim \text{Bernoulli}(1-p)$ and $p$ is dropout rate.

### 6.3 Batch Normalization

For mini-batch $\mathcal{B} = \{x_1, \ldots, x_m\}$:

\begin{align}
\mu_\mathcal{B} &= \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i \\
\sigma_\mathcal{B}^2 &= \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(x_i - \mu_\mathcal{B})^2 \\
\hat{x}_i &= \frac{x_i - \mu_\mathcal{B}}{\sqrt{\sigma_\mathcal{B}^2 + \epsilon}} \\
y_i &= \gamma \hat{x}_i + \beta
\end{align}

## 7. Weight Initialization

### 7.1 Xavier/Glorot Initialization

$$

or with normal distribution:
$$
W \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \frac{2}{n_{in} + n_{out}}\right)
$$

$$
W \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \frac{2}{n_{in}}\right)
$$

$$
(X * K)_{ij} = \sum_{m}\sum_{n} X_{i+m, j+n} K_{m,n}
$$

### 8.2 Output Size

For input size $W$, kernel size $K$, padding $P$, and stride $S$:
$$
W_{out} = \left\lfloor \frac{W - K + 2P}{S} \right\rfloor + 1
$$

### 8.3 Backpropagation Through Convolution

Gradient with respect to input:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial X} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial Y} * K^{rot180}
$$

Gradient with respect to kernel:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial K} = X * \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial Y}
$$

## 9. Recurrent Layers

### 9.1 Simple RNN

$$
h_t = \tanh(W_{hh} h_{t-1} + W_{xh} x_t + b_h)
$$

$$
y_t = W_{hy} h_t + b_y
$$

h_t &= o_t \odot \tanh(C_t) \quad \text{(hidden state)}
\end{align}

### 9.3 GRU

r_t &= \sigma(W_r \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t]) \quad \text{(reset gate)} \\
\tilde{h}_t &= \tanh(W \cdot [r_t \odot h_{t-1}, x_t]) \\
h_t &= (1 - z_t) \odot h_{t-1} + z_t \odot \tilde{h}_t
\end{align}

## 10. Attention Mechanism

### 10.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

### 10.2 Multi-Head Attention

$$
\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \ldots, \text{head}_h)W^O
$$

where:
$$
\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)
$$

## Conclusion

Backpropagation enables efficient gradient computation in neural networks by applying the chain rule systematically from output to input layers. Combined with optimization algorithms like Adam and regularization techniques, it forms the foundation of modern deep learning.

# Statistical Inference and Probability Theory

A comprehensive reference for fundamental statistical formulas and probability theory.

## 1. Descriptive Statistics

### 1.1 Measures of Central Tendency

**Arithmetic Mean:**

For discrete data:
$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
$$

For continuous data with density $f(x)$:
$$
\mu = \mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \cdot f(x) \, dx
$$

**Weighted Mean:**
$$
\bar{x}_w = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}
$$

**Geometric Mean:**
$$
\bar{x}_g = \left(\prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i\right)^{1/n} = \exp\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \ln x_i\right)
$$

### 1.2 Measures of Dispersion

**Variance:**

Population variance:
$$
\sigma^2 = \mathbb{E}[(X-\mu)^2] = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - (\mathbb{E}[X])^2
$$

Sample variance (unbiased):
$$
s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2
$$

**Standard Deviation:**
$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}, \quad s = \sqrt{s^2}
$$

**Coefficient of Variation:**
$$
CV = \frac{\sigma}{\mu} \times 100\%
$$

### 1.3 Higher Moments

**Skewness (Fisher):**
$$
\gamma_1 = \frac{\mathbb{E}[(X-\mu)^3]}{\sigma^3} = \frac{\mu_3}{\sigma^3}
$$

**Kurtosis:**
$$
\gamma_2 = \frac{\mathbb{E}[(X-\mu)^4]}{\sigma^4} - 3 = \frac{\mu_4}{\sigma^4} - 3
$$

---

## 2. Probability Distributions

### 2.1 Discrete Distributions

**Binomial Distribution:**
$$
P(X=k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
$$

where $\mathbb{E}[X] = np$ and $\text{Var}(X) = np(1-p)$

**Poisson Distribution:**
$$
P(X=k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
$$

where $\mathbb{E}[X] = \lambda$ and $\text{Var}(X) = \lambda$

**Geometric Distribution:**
$$
P(X=k) = (1-p)^{k-1} p
$$

### 2.2 Continuous Distributions

**Normal (Gaussian) Distribution:**
$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
$$

Standard normal:
$$
\phi(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-z^2/2}
$$

**Exponential Distribution:**
$$
f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, \quad x \geq 0
$$

**Chi-Square Distribution:**
$$
f(x; k) = \frac{x^{k/2-1} e^{-x/2}}{2^{k/2} \Gamma(k/2)}, \quad x > 0
$$

**Student's t-Distribution:**
$$
f(t) = \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{
u+1}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{
u\pi}\,\Gamma\left(\frac{
u}{2}\right)} \left(1 + \frac{t^2}{
u}\right)^{-\frac{
u+1}{2}}
$$

**F-Distribution:**
$$
f(x; d_1, d_2) = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{(d_1 x)^{d_1} d_2^{d_2}}{(d_1 x + d_2)^{d_1+d_2}}}}{x \cdot B\left(\frac{d_1}{2}, \frac{d_2}{2}\right)}
$$

---

## 3. Hypothesis Testing

### 3.1 Z-Test

Test statistic:
$$
z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}
$$

### 3.2 T-Test

**One-sample t-test:**
$$
t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}
$$

**Two-sample t-test (pooled variance):**
$$
t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{s_p\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}}
$$

where pooled standard deviation:
$$
s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}
$$

### 3.3 Chi-Square Test

$$
\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}
$$

### 3.4 F-Test

$$
F = \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2}
$$

---

## 4. Confidence Intervals

### 4.1 For Population Mean

When $\sigma$ is known:
$$
\bar{x} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

When $\sigma$ is unknown:
$$
\bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-1} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

### 4.2 For Population Proportion

$$
\hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}
$$

---

## 5. Regression Analysis

### 5.1 Simple Linear Regression

Model: $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon$

**Least Squares Estimators:**
$$
\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2} = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}
$$

$$
\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x}
$$

### 5.2 Coefficient of Determination

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}} = 1 - \frac{\sum(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum(y_i - \bar{y})^2}
$$

### 5.3 Multiple Linear Regression

In matrix form:
$$
\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} = (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{y}
$$

---

## 6. Correlation

### 6.1 Pearson Correlation Coefficient

$$
r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
$$

Or equivalently:
$$
r = \frac{n\sum x_i y_i - \sum x_i \sum y_i}{\sqrt{n\sum x_i^2 - (\sum x_i)^2}\sqrt{n\sum y_i^2 - (\sum y_i)^2}}
$$

### 6.2 Spearman Rank Correlation

$$
\rho = 1 - \frac{6\sum d_i^2}{n(n^2-1)}
$$

where $d_i = \text{rank}(x_i) - \text{rank}(y_i)$

---

## 7. Bayesian Statistics

### 7.1 Bayes' Theorem

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

For continuous parameters:
$$
p(\theta|x) = \frac{p(x|\theta) \cdot p(\theta)}{p(x)} = \frac{p(x|\theta) \cdot p(\theta)}{\int p(x|\theta) p(\theta) d\theta}
$$

### 7.2 Posterior Predictive Distribution

$$
p(\tilde{x}|x) = \int p(\tilde{x}|\theta) p(\theta|x) d\theta
$$

---

## 8. Maximum Likelihood Estimation

### 8.1 Likelihood Function

$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i|\theta)
$$

### 8.2 Log-Likelihood

$$
\ell(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log f(x_i|\theta)
$$

### 8.3 MLE Condition

$$
\frac{\partial \ell(\theta)}{\partial \theta} = 0
$$

### 8.4 Fisher Information

$$
I(\theta) = -\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{\partial^2 \ell(\theta)}{\partial \theta^2}\right]
$$

Cramér-Rao Lower Bound:
$$
\text{Var}(\hat{\theta}) \geq \frac{1}{n \cdot I(\theta)}
$$

# Debugging Data Corruption in Node.js Application

## Symptoms

- incorrect data in database
- Eventually leads to system failure
- Occurs under high load conditions

## Environment

- Node.js version: latest
- OS: Linux
- Load: 1000+ requests/second

## Code Under Investigation

```javascript
// Main application code
function processRequest(req) {
    const data = fetchData(req.id);
    const result = transformData(data);
    cache[req.id] = result;  // Potential issue here
    return result;
}
```

## Diagnostic Output

```
Memory Usage Timeline:
T+0min:  512MB
T+10min: 1.2GB
T+20min: 2.5GB
T+30min: 4.1GB (OOM kill)
```

## Heap Analysis

```
Top Memory Consumers:
Object Type      | Count  | Size
-----------------|--------|--------
CachedData       | 50000  | 2.1GB
RequestContext   | 30000  | 800MB
ConnectionPool   | 500    | 50MB
```

## Root Cause

The cache grows unbounded because there's no eviction policy.

## Solution

Implemented LRU cache with size limits:

```javascript
// Fixed implementation
const LRU = require('lru-cache');
const cache = new LRU({
    max: 1000,
    maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 5  // 5 minutes
});

function processRequest(req) {
    const data = fetchData(req.id);
    const result = transformData(data);
    cache.set(req.id, result);
    return result;
}
```

## Verification

After fix:
- Memory stable at ~600MB
- No OOM kills in 7 days
- Performance improved 20%

## Lessons

1. Always set limits on caches
2. Monitor memory usage
3. Use profiling tools early
4. Test under realistic load

# Migrating Our Infrastructure: monolith to microservices architecture

*Posted on December 06, 2025 by Engineering Team*

## Introduction

Over the past year, our platform has experienced tremendous growth. This post 
details our journey migrating monolith to microservices architecture.

## The Challenge

As our user base grew from 10K to 1M+ users, we faced several challenges:

- **Performance**: Response times increased to 2-3 seconds
- **Scalability**: Single server couldn't handle peak load
- **Reliability**: Downtime during deployments
- **Cost**: Infrastructure costs growing faster than revenue

## Initial Architecture

Our original setup:

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Client    │
└─────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  Web Server │
│  (Single)   │
└─────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  PostgreSQL │
│  (Primary)  │
└─────────────┘
```

## Solution Design

After extensive research and prototyping, we designed a new architecture:

```
┌─────────────┐
│Load Balancer│
└─────────────┘
       │
    ┌──┴──┐
    ▼     ▼
┌─────┐ ┌─────┐
│Web-1│ │Web-2│ ...
└─────┘ └─────┘
    │     │
    └──┬──┘
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   Redis     │
│   Cache     │
└─────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  PostgreSQL │
│  (Primary)  │
└─────────────┘
```

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

```bash
# Set up Kubernetes cluster
kubectl create namespace production

# Deploy Redis
helm install redis bitnami/redis \
    --set auth.password=$REDIS_PASSWORD \
    --set replica.replicaCount=3
```

### Phase 2: Application Changes

```python
# Before: Direct database queries
def get_user(user_id):
    return db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", user_id)

# After: Cache-first approach
def get_user(user_id):
    # Try cache first
    cached = redis.get(f"user:{user_id}")
    if cached:
        return json.loads(cached)
    
    # Fallback to database
    user = db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", user_id)
    
    # Cache for 5 minutes
    redis.setex(f"user:{user_id}", 300, json.dumps(user))
    
    return user
```

### Phase 3: Monitoring

```python
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram

request_count = Counter('requests_total', 'Total requests')
request_duration = Histogram('request_duration_seconds', 'Request duration')

@app.route('/api/data')
@request_duration.time()
def get_data():
    request_count.inc()
    return fetch_data()
```

## Results

### Performance Improvements

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| P50 Latency | 800ms | 95ms | -88% |
| P99 Latency | 3.2s | 250ms | -92% |
| Throughput | 100 req/s | 5000 req/s | +4900% |
| Error Rate | 2.5% | 0.1% | -96% |

### Cost Analysis

- Infrastructure cost increased by 40%
- Revenue increased by 200%
- Cost per user decreased by 50%

## Lessons Learned

1. **Measure First**: Extensive profiling revealed surprising bottlenecks
2. **Iterate Quickly**: We deployed incrementally over 3 months
3. **Monitor Everything**: Metrics were crucial for optimization
4. **Team Alignment**: Regular syncs kept everyone informed

## Challenges

### Cache Invalidation

Cache invalidation proved tricky. We implemented a pub/sub pattern:

```python
# Publisher (on data update)
def update_user(user_id, data):
    db.update("users", user_id, data)
    redis.publish('user_updates', json.dumps({
        'id': user_id,
        'action': 'update'
    }))

# Subscriber (cache invalidator)
def handle_update(message):
    data = json.loads(message)
    redis.delete(f"user:{data['id']}")
```

### Database Migration

Zero-downtime migration required careful planning:

1. Set up replication
2. Switch reads to replica
3. Migrate writes
4. Promote replica to primary

## Future Work

- Implement database sharding for further scaling
- Add CDN for static assets
- Explore serverless for batch jobs
- Improve observability with distributed tracing

## Conclusion

This project significantly improved our platform's performance and reliability.
The key was methodical planning, incremental rollout, and comprehensive monitoring.

# How to Write Technical Documentation

A comprehensive guide for creating effective markdown documentation.

## Getting Started

Technical documentation should be clear, concise, and well-structured.

## Including Code Examples

### Basic Code Blocks

Use triple backticks for simple code:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

### Showing Markdown Examples

When documenting markdown syntax itself, use quadruple backticks:

````markdown
To create a header:

# Main Title
## Subsection
### Detail Level
````

### Meta-Documentation Pattern

For tutorials about writing documentation:

`````markdown
# Documentation Best Practices

## Code Example Section

Show code with context:

````markdown
First explain the concept, then show:

```python
# Implementation
def process():
    return "result"
```
````
`````

## Real-World Tutorial Example

````markdown
# Python Tutorial: Functions

## Defining Functions

Use the `def` keyword:

```python
def greet(name):
    """Return a greeting message."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

## Calling Functions

```python
message = greet("Alice")
print(message)  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```
````

## README Template

Here's a template for README files:

`````markdown
# Project Name

## Installation

```bash
pip install project-name
```

## Quick Start

```python
import project

# Basic usage
result = project.run()
```

## Advanced Usage

For complex scenarios:

````markdown
### Custom Configuration

```python
config = {
    'option1': 'value1',
    'option2': 'value2'
}
project.run(config)
```
````
`````

## Style Guide

When creating style guides, use nested fences to show examples:

````markdown
### Code Documentation

All functions must have docstrings:

```python
def calculate(x, y):
    """
    Calculate the sum of two numbers.
    
    Args:
        x: First number
        y: Second number
    
    Returns:
        Sum of x and y
    """
    return x + y
```
````

## Conclusion

Nested fencing enables clear, unambiguous documentation about markdown syntax itself.

# Mixed Fence Types Documentation

## Overview

This document demonstrates mixing backtick and tilde fences in the same document.

## Backtick Fences Containing Tildes

When documenting tilde-based examples using backticks:

````markdown
Here's how to use tilde fences:

~~~bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Script using tilde fences"
ls -la
~~~
````

## Tilde Fences Containing Backticks

When documenting backtick-based examples using tildes:

~~~~markdown
Here's how to use backtick fences:

```python
def process_data(items):
    """Process a list of items."""
    return [item.strip() for item in items]
```
~~~~

## Real-World Use Case

A tutorial showing both fence types:

````markdown
### Option 1: Using Backticks

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

### Option 2: Using Tildes

~~~javascript
const farewell = "Goodbye!";
console.log(farewell);
~~~
````

## Alternating Examples

First example with backticks:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from Go")
}
```

Second example with tildes:

~~~rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello from Rust");
}
~~~

Both fence types work seamlessly together.

# Tilde Fencing Guide

## Introduction

This guide demonstrates the use of tilde fencing as an alternative to backticks in markdown.

## Basic Tilde Fencing

Use triple tildes for standard code blocks:

~~~python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Call the function
result = greet("World")
print(result)
~~~

## Nested Tilde Fencing

For documentation that shows tilde-fenced examples:

~~~~markdown
To display Python code with tildes:

~~~python
def calculate_area(radius):
    import math
    return math.pi * radius ** 2
~~~
~~~~

## Mixed Content Example

Combining text and tilde-fenced code:

~~~javascript
function factorial(n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

console.log(factorial(5));  // Output: 120
~~~

The recursive approach is elegant but may cause stack overflow for large values.

# Research Notes: Database Theory Study

## Abstract

This document summarizes research findings on database theory 
optimization techniques. We investigate novel approaches and 
compare them with existing baselines.

## Literature Review

### Key Papers

1. Smith et al. (2023) - "Advanced Techniques in Database Theory"
2. Jones & Brown (2022) - "Optimization Strategies"
3. Lee et al. (2021) - "Benchmark Analysis"

### Related Work

Previous studies have shown that traditional approaches have 
limitations. Our work builds on [Smith2023] and extends it
with new methodologies.

## Methodology

### Experimental Setup

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Configuration
config = {
    'dataset_size': 10000,
    'test_split': 0.2,
    'random_seed': 42
}

# Load and prepare data
data = load_dataset(config['dataset_size'])
train, test = split_data(data, config['test_split'])
```

### Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Our Approach | Improvement |
|--------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Accuracy | 0.85 | 0.92 | +8.2% |
| Latency | 150ms | 95ms | -36.7% |
| Memory | 2GB | 1.2GB | -40% |

## Results

### Primary Findings

Our approach demonstrates significant improvements:

```python
# Results analysis
results = {
    'accuracy': 0.92,
    'precision': 0.89,
    'recall': 0.94,
    'f1_score': 0.91
}

print(f"F1 Score: {results['f1_score']:.2f}")
```

### Statistical Significance

- p-value < 0.01 for all metrics
- 95% confidence intervals shown in Table 1
- Reproducible across 10 independent runs

## Discussion

The results indicate that our approach is superior to baselines
in most scenarios. However, edge cases require further investigation.

### Limitations

1. Dataset size limited to 10K samples
2. Single domain evaluation
3. Computational cost for training

## Conclusions

This research demonstrates feasibility of the proposed approach.
Future work will address current limitations and explore
additional domains.

# Calculus and Mathematical Analysis

Essential formulas from differential and integral calculus.

## 1. Limits and Continuity

### 1.1 Definition of Limit

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L \iff \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 : 0 < |x-a| < \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - L| < \epsilon
$$

### 1.2 Important Limits

**Fundamental limits:**
$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1 - \cos x}{x^2} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^x - 1}{x} = 1
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\ln(1+x)}{x} = 1
$$

**Euler's number:**
$$
e = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n = \lim_{x \to 0} (1+x)^{1/x}
$$

### 1.3 L'Hôpital's Rule

If $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} g(x) = 0$ or $\pm\infty$:
$$
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}
$$

---

## 2. Derivatives

### 2.1 Definition

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

### 2.2 Basic Rules

**Sum rule:**
$$
(f + g)' = f' + g'
$$

**Product rule:**
$$
(fg)' = f'g + fg'
$$

**Quotient rule:**
$$
\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)' = \frac{f'g - fg'}{g^2}
$$

**Chain rule:**
$$
(f \circ g)'(x) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)
$$

### 2.3 Common Derivatives

| Function | Derivative |
|----------|------------|
| $x^n$ | $nx^{n-1}$ |
| $e^x$ | $e^x$ |
| $\ln x$ | $\frac{1}{x}$ |
| $\sin x$ | $\cos x$ |
| $\cos x$ | $-\sin x$ |
| $\tan x$ | $\sec^2 x$ |

### 2.4 Implicit Differentiation

For $F(x, y) = 0$:
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{\partial F/\partial x}{\partial F/\partial y} = -\frac{F_x}{F_y}
$$

---

## 3. Taylor Series

### 3.1 Taylor Expansion

$$
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n
$$

**Maclaurin series** (Taylor at $a=0$):
$$
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n
$$

### 3.2 Common Expansions

$$
e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!} = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots
$$

$$
\sin x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!} = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \cdots
$$

$$
\cos x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n}}{(2n)!} = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \cdots
$$

$$
\ln(1+x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1} x^n}{n} = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots
$$

### 3.3 Remainder Term

Lagrange form:
$$
R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(\xi)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}
$$

for some $\xi$ between $a$ and $x$.

$$

### 4.2 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

**Part 1:**
$$
\frac{d}{dx}\int_a^x f(t)\,dt = f(x)
$$

**Part 2:**
$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

where $F'(x) = f(x)$

### 4.3 Integration Techniques

**Integration by parts:**
$$
\int u\,dv = uv - \int v\,du
$$

**Substitution:**
$$
\int f(g(x))g'(x)\,dx = \int f(u)\,du
$$

### 4.4 Common Integrals

$$
\int x^n \, dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C, \quad n \neq -1
$$

$$
\int e^x \, dx = e^x + C
$$

$$
\int \frac{1}{x} \, dx = \ln|x| + C
$$

$$
\int \sin x \, dx = -\cos x + C
$$

$$
\int \frac{1}{1+x^2} \, dx = \arctan x + C
$$

$$
\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \, dx = \arcsin x + C
$$

$$

### 5.3 Directional Derivative

$$
D_{\mathbf{u}}f = \nabla f \cdot \mathbf{u} = |\nabla f| \cos \theta
$$

### 5.4 Chain Rule (Multivariable)

For $z = f(x, y)$ where $x = g(t)$ and $y = h(t)$:
$$
\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{dy}{dt}
$$

### 5.5 Jacobian Matrix

For $\mathbf{f}: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$:
$$
\mathbf{J} = \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_n}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### 5.6 Hessian Matrix

\vdots & \vdots & \ddots
\end{pmatrix}
$$

\frac{\partial}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \\
F_x & F_y & F_z
\end{vmatrix}
$$

### 6.3 Laplacian

\nabla^2 f = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z^2}
$$

### 6.4 Integral Theorems

**Green's Theorem:**
$$
\oint_C (P\,dx + Q\,dy) = \iint_D \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) dA
$$

**Stokes' Theorem:**
$$
\oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \iint_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot d\mathbf{S}
$$

**Divergence Theorem:**

\iint_S \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = \iiint_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}) \, dV
$$

y = e^{-\int P\,dx}\left(\int Q e^{\int P\,dx}\,dx + C\right)
$$

### 7.2 Second-Order Linear ODE

Form: $ay'' + by' + cy = 0$

Characteristic equation: $ar^2 + br + c = 0$

**General solution:**
- Distinct real roots $r_1, r_2$: $y = C_1 e^{r_1 x} + C_2 e^{r_2 x}$
- Repeated root $r$: $y = (C_1 + C_2 x)e^{rx}$
- Complex roots $\alpha \pm \beta i$: $y = e^{\alpha x}(C_1 \cos\beta x + C_2 \sin\beta x)$

**Dot product:**
$$
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i = |\mathbf{a}||\mathbf{b}|\cos\theta
$$

**Cross product** (in $\mathbb{R}^3$):

a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\
b_1 & b_2 & b_3
\end{vmatrix}
$$

### 1.2 Norms

**$L^p$ norm:**
$$
||\mathbf{x}||_p = \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i|^p\right)^{1/p}
$$

**Common norms:**
$$
||\mathbf{x}||_1 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i| \quad \text{(Manhattan)}
$$

$$
||\mathbf{x}||_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2} \quad \text{(Euclidean)}
$$

\text{proj}_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{b} = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{||\mathbf{a}||^2}\mathbf{a}
$$

Projection onto subspace spanned by columns of $A$:
$$

$$

---

## 2. Matrices

(A\mathbf{x})_i = \sum_{j=1}^{n} A_{ij}x_j
$$

**Matrix-matrix multiplication:**

(AB)_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{m} A_{ik}B_{kj}
$$

### 2.2 Special Matrices

**Identity matrix:**
$$
I = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

**Diagonal matrix:**
$$
D = \text{diag}(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n)
$$

**Symmetric:** $A = A^T$

**Orthogonal:** $Q^TQ = QQ^T = I$

**Positive definite:** $\mathbf{x}^T A \mathbf{x} > 0$ for all $\mathbf{x} \neq 0$

### 2.3 Matrix Norms

**Frobenius norm:**
$$
||A||_F = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n} |a_{ij}|^2} = \sqrt{\text{tr}(A^T A)}
$$

---

## 3. Determinants and Inverses

### 3.1 Determinant Properties

$$
\det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B)
$$

$$
\det(A^{-1}) = \frac{1}{\det(A)}
$$

$$
\det(A^T) = \det(A)
$$

$$
\det(cA) = c^n \det(A) \quad \text{for } A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}
$$

### 3.2 2×2 Matrix

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}
$$

$$
\det(A) = ad - bc
$$

$$
A^{-1} = \frac{1}{ad-bc}\begin{pmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{pmatrix}
$$

### 3.3 General Inverse

$$
A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)} \text{adj}(A)
$$

where $\text{adj}(A)$ is the adjugate (transpose of cofactor matrix).

### 3.4 Sherman-Morrison Formula

$$
(A + \mathbf{u}\mathbf{v}^T)^{-1} = A^{-1} - \frac{A^{-1}\mathbf{u}\mathbf{v}^T A^{-1}}{1 + \mathbf{v}^T A^{-1}\mathbf{u}}
$$

---

## 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

### 4.1 Definition

For matrix $A$:
$$
A\mathbf{v} = \lambda\mathbf{v}
$$

where $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue and $\mathbf{v}$ is the corresponding eigenvector.

### 4.2 Characteristic Equation

$$
\det(A - \lambda I) = 0
$$

### 4.3 Properties

$$
\text{tr}(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i
$$

$$
\det(A) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i
$$

### 4.4 Eigendecomposition

For diagonalizable matrix:
$$
A = V\Lambda V^{-1}
$$

where $V$ contains eigenvectors and $\Lambda = \text{diag}(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n)$

**Matrix powers:**
$$
A^k = V\Lambda^k V^{-1}
$$

### 4.5 Spectral Theorem

For symmetric $A$:
$$
A = Q\Lambda Q^T
$$

where $Q$ is orthogonal and $\Lambda$ is diagonal with real eigenvalues.

---

## 5. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

### 5.1 Full SVD

For any $m \times n$ matrix $A$:
$$
A = U\Sigma V^T
$$

where:
- $U$ is $m \times m$ orthogonal (left singular vectors)
- $\Sigma$ is $m \times n$ diagonal (singular values)
- $V$ is $n \times n$ orthogonal (right singular vectors)

### 5.2 Reduced SVD

$$
A = U_r \Sigma_r V_r^T
$$

where $r = \text{rank}(A)$

### 5.3 Properties

Singular values: $\sigma_i = \sqrt{\lambda_i(A^T A)}$

**Low-rank approximation (Eckart-Young):**
$$
A_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sigma_i \mathbf{u}_i \mathbf{v}_i^T
$$

minimizes $||A - B||_F$ over all rank-$k$ matrices $B$.

### 5.4 Pseudoinverse

$$
A^+ = V\Sigma^+ U^T
$$

where $\Sigma^+$ has $1/\sigma_i$ on diagonal for nonzero $\sigma_i$

## 6. Matrix Calculus

### 6.1 Scalar by Vector

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{x}}(\mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{a}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{x}}(\mathbf{x}^T A\mathbf{x}) = (A + A^T)\mathbf{x}
$$

For symmetric $A$:
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{x}}(\mathbf{x}^T A\mathbf{x}) = 2A\mathbf{x}
$$

### 6.2 Vector by Vector

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{x}}(A\mathbf{x}) = A
$$

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{x}}(\mathbf{x}^T A) = A^T
$$

### 6.3 Scalar by Matrix

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial A}\text{tr}(AB) = B^T
$$

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial A}\text{tr}(ABA^T) = A(B + B^T)
$$

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial A}\log\det(A) = A^{-T}
$$

---

## 7. QR Decomposition

$$
A = QR
$$

where $Q$ is orthogonal and $R$ is upper triangular.

**Gram-Schmidt process:**

\begin{align}
\mathbf{u}_1 &= \mathbf{a}_1 \\
\mathbf{u}_k &= \mathbf{a}_k - \sum_{j=1}^{k-1} \text{proj}_{\mathbf{u}_j}\mathbf{a}_k \\
\mathbf{q}_k &= \frac{\mathbf{u}_k}{||\mathbf{u}_k||}
\end{align}

## 8. Least Squares

### 8.1 Normal Equations

For $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ (overdetermined):
$$
A^T A \mathbf{x} = A^T \mathbf{b}
$$

$$

# Machine Learning Mathematical Foundations

This document covers essential mathematical equations used in machine learning, including distance measures, loss functions, and generative model formulations.

## 1. Distance Measures

### 1.1 Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL-Divergence)

KL-Divergence measures how one probability distribution diverges from a second expected probability distribution:

$$
KL(P||Q) = \sum_{x} P(x) \log\left(\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\right)
$$

For continuous distributions:

$$
KL(P||Q) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \log\left(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\right) dx
$$

**Properties:**
- Non-negative: $KL(P||Q) \geq 0$
- Asymmetric: $KL(P||Q) \neq KL(Q||P)$
- Zero iff $P = Q$

### 1.2 Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JS-Divergence)

A symmetric version of KL-Divergence:

$$
JS(P||Q) = \frac{1}{2}KL\left(P||\frac{P+Q}{2}\right) + \frac{1}{2}KL\left(Q||\frac{P+Q}{2}\right)
$$

This is bounded: $0 \leq JS(P||Q) \leq \log 2$

### 1.3 Wasserstein Distance (Optimal Transport)

Also known as Earth Mover's Distance:

$$
W_{p}(P,Q) = \left(\inf_{J \in \mathcal{J}(P,Q)} \int ||x-y||^{p} dJ(x,y)\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}
$$

For $p=1$, this simplifies to:

$$
W_1(P,Q) = \inf_{\gamma \in \Pi(P,Q)} \mathbb{E}_{(x,y) \sim \gamma}[||x - y||]
$$

### 1.4 Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)

A kernel-based distance measure:

$$
\text{MMD}(\mathcal{F}, X, Y) := \sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \left(\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} f(x_i) - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n} f(y_j)\right)
$$

With kernel $k$:

$$
\text{MMD}^2 = \mathbb{E}[k(x,x')] - 2\mathbb{E}[k(x,y)] + \mathbb{E}[k(y,y')]
$$

### 1.5 Mahalanobis Distance

Distance accounting for correlations in the data:

$$
D_M(x, y) = \sqrt{(x-y)^T \Sigma^{-1} (x-y)}
$$

where $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix.

## 2. Generative Models

### 2.1 Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

$$
\min_G \max_D V(D,G) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}(x)}[\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)}[\log(1-D(G(z)))]
$$

**Optimal discriminator:**

$$
D^*(x) = \frac{p_{data}(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)}
$$

**Generator loss (non-saturating):**

$$
\mathcal{L}_G = -\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)}[\log D(G(z))]
$$

### 2.2 Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)

#### Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\theta,\phi}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}[\log p_\theta(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z}) - \log q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})]
$$

Equivalently:

$$
\log p_\theta(\mathbf{x}) \geq \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}[\log p_\theta(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z})] - D_{KL}(q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}) || p(\mathbf{z}))
$$

#### Reparameterization Trick

$$
\mathbf{z} = \boldsymbol{\mu} + \boldsymbol{\sigma} \odot \boldsymbol{\epsilon}, \quad \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)
$$

### 2.3 Diffusion Models (DDPM)

#### Forward Process

$$
q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t}x_{t-1}, \beta_t I)
$$

$$
q(x_{1:T}|x_0) = \prod_{t=1}^{T} q(x_t|x_{t-1})
$$

#### Reparameterization

$$
x_t = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t} \epsilon
$$

where $\alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t$ and $\bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{s=1}^{t} \alpha_s$

#### Reverse Process

$$
p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{0:T}) = p(\mathbf{x}_T) \prod_{t=1}^{T} p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}|\mathbf{x}_t)
$$

$$
p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}|\mathbf{x}_t) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}; \boldsymbol{\mu}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t), \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t))
$$

#### Training Objective

\begin{align}
L_{simple} &= \mathbb{E}_{t, x_0, \epsilon}\left[||\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)||^2\right]
\end{align}

# Neural Network Backpropagation: A Mathematical Treatment

## Abstract

This document provides a rigorous mathematical derivation of the backpropagation algorithm for training feedforward neural networks. We cover the chain rule application, gradient computation, and common activation functions.

## 1. Introduction

Neural networks learn by adjusting weights to minimize a loss function. The backpropagation algorithm efficiently computes gradients of the loss with respect to each weight using the chain rule of calculus.

Consider a network with $L$ layers, where layer $l$ has weights $W^{(l)}$ and biases $b^{(l)}$.

## 2. Forward Propagation

### 2.1 Layer Computations

For each layer $l = 1, \ldots, L$:

**Pre-activation:**
$$
z^{(l)} = W^{(l)} a^{(l-1)} + b^{(l)}
$$

**Activation:**
$$
a^{(l)} = \sigma(z^{(l)})
$$

where $a^{(0)} = x$ (input) and $\sigma$ is the activation function.

### 2.2 Activation Functions

**Sigmoid:**
$$
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}, \quad \sigma'(z) = \sigma(z)(1 - \sigma(z))
$$

**Tanh:**
$$
\tanh(z) = \frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{e^z + e^{-z}}, \quad \tanh'(z) = 1 - \tanh^2(z)
$$

**ReLU:**
$$
\text{ReLU}(z) = \max(0, z), \quad \text{ReLU}'(z) = \begin{cases} 1 & z > 0 \\ 0 & z \leq 0 \end{cases}
$$

**Leaky ReLU:**
$$
\text{LeakyReLU}(z) = \begin{cases} z & z > 0 \\ \alpha z & z \leq 0 \end{cases}
$$

**Softmax** (for output layer):
$$
\text{softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j}}
$$

**GELU:**
$$
\text{GELU}(x) = x \cdot \Phi(x) = x \cdot \frac{1}{2}\left[1 + \text{erf}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\right]
$$

## 3. Loss Functions

### 3.1 Mean Squared Error

For regression:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{MSE} = \frac{1}{2N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}||y_i - \hat{y}_i||^2
$$

Gradient with respect to output:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{MSE}}{\partial \hat{y}} = \hat{y} - y
$$

### 3.2 Cross-Entropy Loss

For classification with softmax output:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{CE} = -\sum_{c=1}^{C} y_c \log(\hat{y}_c)
$$

Combined gradient (cross-entropy + softmax):
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{CE}}{\partial z_i} = \hat{y}_i - y_i
$$

## 4. Backpropagation Algorithm

### 4.1 Output Layer Error

Define the error signal at layer $l$:
$$
\delta^{(l)} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial z^{(l)}}
$$

For the output layer $L$:
$$
\delta^{(L)} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial a^{(L)}} \odot \sigma'(z^{(L)})
$$

### 4.2 Hidden Layer Errors

For layers $l = L-1, \ldots, 1$:
$$
\delta^{(l)} = (W^{(l+1)})^T \delta^{(l+1)} \odot \sigma'(z^{(l)})
$$

### 4.3 Gradient Computation

**Weight gradients:**
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{(l)}} = \delta^{(l)} (a^{(l-1)})^T
$$

**Bias gradients:**
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b^{(l)}} = \delta^{(l)}
$$

### 4.4 Batch Gradient

For a mini-batch of $m$ samples:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{(l)}} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} \delta_i^{(l)} (a_i^{(l-1)})^T
$$

## 5. Optimization

### 5.1 Stochastic Gradient Descent

$$
W_{t+1} = W_t - \eta \nabla_W \mathcal{L}
$$

### 5.2 Momentum

$$
v_{t+1} = \gamma v_t + \eta \nabla_W \mathcal{L}
$$

$$
W_{t+1} = W_t - v_{t+1}
$$

### 5.3 Adam Optimizer

\begin{align}
m_t &= \beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_1) g_t \\
v_t &= \beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_2) g_t^2 \\
\hat{m}_t &= \frac{m_t}{1 - \beta_1^t} \\
\hat{v}_t &= \frac{v_t}{1 - \beta_2^t} \\
W_{t+1} &= W_t - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{\hat{v}_t} + \epsilon} \hat{m}_t
\end{align}

## 6. Regularization

### 6.1 L2 Regularization (Weight Decay)

$$
\mathcal{L}_{reg} = \mathcal{L} + \frac{\lambda}{2}\sum_l ||W^{(l)}||_F^2
$$

$$
\nabla_{W^{(l)}} \mathcal{L}_{reg} = \nabla_{W^{(l)}} \mathcal{L} + \lambda W^{(l)}
$$

### 6.2 Dropout

During training, randomly set activations to zero:
$$
\tilde{a}^{(l)} = \frac{1}{1-p} \cdot a^{(l)} \odot m^{(l)}
$$

where $m^{(l)} \sim \text{Bernoulli}(1-p)$ and $p$ is dropout rate.

### 6.3 Batch Normalization

For mini-batch $\mathcal{B} = \{x_1, \ldots, x_m\}$:

\begin{align}
\mu_\mathcal{B} &= \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i \\
\sigma_\mathcal{B}^2 &= \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(x_i - \mu_\mathcal{B})^2 \\
\hat{x}_i &= \frac{x_i - \mu_\mathcal{B}}{\sqrt{\sigma_\mathcal{B}^2 + \epsilon}} \\
y_i &= \gamma \hat{x}_i + \beta
\end{align}

## 7. Weight Initialization

### 7.1 Xavier/Glorot Initialization

$$

$$

or with normal distribution:
$$

$$

### 7.2 He Initialization

$$
W \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \frac{2}{n_{in}}\right)
$$

$$
(X * K)_{ij} = \sum_{m}\sum_{n} X_{i+m, j+n} K_{m,n}
$$

### 8.2 Output Size

For input size $W$, kernel size $K$, padding $P$, and stride $S$:
$$
W_{out} = \left\lfloor \frac{W - K + 2P}{S} \right\rfloor + 1
$$

### 8.3 Backpropagation Through Convolution

Gradient with respect to input:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial X} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial Y} * K^{rot180}
$$

Gradient with respect to kernel:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial K} = X * \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial Y}
$$

## 9. Recurrent Layers

$$
h_t = \tanh(W_{hh} h_{t-1} + W_{xh} x_t + b_h)
$$

$$
y_t = W_{hy} h_t + b_y
$$

h_t &= o_t \odot \tanh(C_t) \quad \text{(hidden state)}
\end{align}

### 9.3 GRU

\begin{align}
z_t &= \sigma(W_z \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t]) \quad \text{(update gate)} \\
r_t &= \sigma(W_r \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t]) \quad \text{(reset gate)} \\
\tilde{h}_t &= \tanh(W \cdot [r_t \odot h_{t-1}, x_t]) \\
h_t &= (1 - z_t) \odot h_{t-1} + z_t \odot \tilde{h}_t
\end{align}

## 10. Attention Mechanism

### 10.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

### 10.2 Multi-Head Attention

$$
\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \ldots, \text{head}_h)W^O
$$

where:
$$
\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)
$$

## Conclusion

Backpropagation enables efficient gradient computation in neural networks by applying the chain rule systematically from output to input layers. Combined with optimization algorithms like Adam and regularization techniques, it forms the foundation of modern deep learning.

# Statistical Inference and Probability Theory

A comprehensive reference for fundamental statistical formulas and probability theory.

## 1. Descriptive Statistics

### 1.1 Measures of Central Tendency

**Arithmetic Mean:**

For discrete data:
$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
$$

For continuous data with density $f(x)$:
$$
\mu = \mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \cdot f(x) \, dx
$$

**Weighted Mean:**
$$
\bar{x}_w = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}
$$

**Geometric Mean:**
$$
\bar{x}_g = \left(\prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i\right)^{1/n} = \exp\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \ln x_i\right)
$$

### 1.2 Measures of Dispersion

**Variance:**

Population variance:
$$
\sigma^2 = \mathbb{E}[(X-\mu)^2] = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - (\mathbb{E}[X])^2
$$

Sample variance (unbiased):
$$
s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2
$$

**Standard Deviation:**
$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}, \quad s = \sqrt{s^2}
$$

**Coefficient of Variation:**
$$
CV = \frac{\sigma}{\mu} \times 100\%
$$

### 1.3 Higher Moments

**Skewness (Fisher):**
$$
\gamma_1 = \frac{\mathbb{E}[(X-\mu)^3]}{\sigma^3} = \frac{\mu_3}{\sigma^3}
$$

**Kurtosis:**
$$
\gamma_2 = \frac{\mathbb{E}[(X-\mu)^4]}{\sigma^4} - 3 = \frac{\mu_4}{\sigma^4} - 3
$$

---

## 2. Probability Distributions

### 2.1 Discrete Distributions

**Binomial Distribution:**
$$
P(X=k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
$$

where $\mathbb{E}[X] = np$ and $\text{Var}(X) = np(1-p)$

**Poisson Distribution:**
$$
P(X=k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
$$

where $\mathbb{E}[X] = \lambda$ and $\text{Var}(X) = \lambda$

**Geometric Distribution:**
$$
P(X=k) = (1-p)^{k-1} p
$$

### 2.2 Continuous Distributions

**Normal (Gaussian) Distribution:**
$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
$$

Standard normal:
$$
\phi(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-z^2/2}
$$

**Exponential Distribution:**
$$
f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, \quad x \geq 0
$$

**Chi-Square Distribution:**
$$
f(x; k) = \frac{x^{k/2-1} e^{-x/2}}{2^{k/2} \Gamma(k/2)}, \quad x > 0
$$

**Student's t-Distribution:**
$$
f(t) = \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{
u+1}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{
u\pi}\,\Gamma\left(\frac{
u}{2}\right)} \left(1 + \frac{t^2}{
u}\right)^{-\frac{
u+1}{2}}
$$

**F-Distribution:**
$$
f(x; d_1, d_2) = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{(d_1 x)^{d_1} d_2^{d_2}}{(d_1 x + d_2)^{d_1+d_2}}}}{x \cdot B\left(\frac{d_1}{2}, \frac{d_2}{2}\right)}
$$

---

## 3. Hypothesis Testing

### 3.1 Z-Test

Test statistic:
$$
z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}
$$

### 3.2 T-Test

**One-sample t-test:**
$$
t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}
$$

**Two-sample t-test (pooled variance):**
$$
t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{s_p\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}}
$$

where pooled standard deviation:
$$
s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}
$$

### 3.3 Chi-Square Test

$$
\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}
$$

### 3.4 F-Test

$$
F = \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2}
$$

---

## 4. Confidence Intervals

### 4.1 For Population Mean

When $\sigma$ is known:
$$
\bar{x} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

When $\sigma$ is unknown:
$$
\bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-1} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

### 4.2 For Population Proportion

$$
\hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}
$$

---

## 5. Regression Analysis

### 5.1 Simple Linear Regression

Model: $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon$

**Least Squares Estimators:**
$$
\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2} = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}
$$

$$
\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x}
$$

### 5.2 Coefficient of Determination

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}} = 1 - \frac{\sum(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum(y_i - \bar{y})^2}
$$

### 5.3 Multiple Linear Regression

In matrix form:
$$
\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} = (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{y}
$$

---

## 6. Correlation

### 6.1 Pearson Correlation Coefficient

$$
r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
$$

Or equivalently:
$$
r = \frac{n\sum x_i y_i - \sum x_i \sum y_i}{\sqrt{n\sum x_i^2 - (\sum x_i)^2}\sqrt{n\sum y_i^2 - (\sum y_i)^2}}
$$

### 6.2 Spearman Rank Correlation

$$
\rho = 1 - \frac{6\sum d_i^2}{n(n^2-1)}
$$

where $d_i = \text{rank}(x_i) - \text{rank}(y_i)$

---

## 7. Bayesian Statistics

### 7.1 Bayes' Theorem

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

For continuous parameters:
$$
p(\theta|x) = \frac{p(x|\theta) \cdot p(\theta)}{p(x)} = \frac{p(x|\theta) \cdot p(\theta)}{\int p(x|\theta) p(\theta) d\theta}
$$

### 7.2 Posterior Predictive Distribution

$$
p(\tilde{x}|x) = \int p(\tilde{x}|\theta) p(\theta|x) d\theta
$$

---

## 8. Maximum Likelihood Estimation

### 8.1 Likelihood Function

$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i|\theta)
$$

### 8.2 Log-Likelihood

$$
\ell(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log f(x_i|\theta)
$$

### 8.3 MLE Condition

$$
\frac{\partial \ell(\theta)}{\partial \theta} = 0
$$

### 8.4 Fisher Information

$$
I(\theta) = -\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{\partial^2 \ell(\theta)}{\partial \theta^2}\right]
$$

Cramér-Rao Lower Bound:
$$
\text{Var}(\hat{\theta}) \geq \frac{1}{n \cdot I(\theta)}
$$

# Debugging Data Corruption in Node.js Application

## Symptoms

- incorrect data in database
- Eventually leads to system failure
- Occurs under high load conditions

## Environment

- Node.js version: latest
- OS: Linux
- Load: 1000+ requests/second

## Code Under Investigation

```javascript
// Main application code
function processRequest(req) {
    const data = fetchData(req.id);
    const result = transformData(data);
    cache[req.id] = result;  // Potential issue here
    return result;
}
```

## Diagnostic Output

```
Memory Usage Timeline:
T+0min:  512MB
T+10min: 1.2GB
T+20min: 2.5GB
T+30min: 4.1GB (OOM kill)
```

## Heap Analysis

```
Top Memory Consumers:
Object Type      | Count  | Size
-----------------|--------|--------
CachedData       | 50000  | 2.1GB
RequestContext   | 30000  | 800MB
ConnectionPool   | 500    | 50MB
```

## Root Cause

The cache grows unbounded because there's no eviction policy.

## Solution

Implemented LRU cache with size limits:

```javascript
// Fixed implementation
const LRU = require('lru-cache');
const cache = new LRU({
    max: 1000,
    maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 5  // 5 minutes
});

function processRequest(req) {
    const data = fetchData(req.id);
    const result = transformData(data);
    cache.set(req.id, result);
    return result;
}
```

## Verification

After fix:
- Memory stable at ~600MB
- No OOM kills in 7 days
- Performance improved 20%

## Lessons

1. Always set limits on caches
2. Monitor memory usage
3. Use profiling tools early
4. Test under realistic load

# Migrating Our Infrastructure: monolith to microservices architecture

*Posted on December 06, 2025 by Engineering Team*

## Introduction

Over the past year, our platform has experienced tremendous growth. This post 
details our journey migrating monolith to microservices architecture.

## The Challenge

As our user base grew from 10K to 1M+ users, we faced several challenges:

- **Performance**: Response times increased to 2-3 seconds
- **Scalability**: Single server couldn't handle peak load
- **Reliability**: Downtime during deployments
- **Cost**: Infrastructure costs growing faster than revenue

## Initial Architecture

Our original setup:

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Client    │
└─────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  Web Server │
│  (Single)   │
└─────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  PostgreSQL │
│  (Primary)  │
└─────────────┘
```

## Solution Design

After extensive research and prototyping, we designed a new architecture:

```
┌─────────────┐
│Load Balancer│
└─────────────┘
       │
    ┌──┴──┐
    ▼     ▼
┌─────┐ ┌─────┐
│Web-1│ │Web-2│ ...
└─────┘ └─────┘
    │     │
    └──┬──┘
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   Redis     │
│   Cache     │
└─────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  PostgreSQL │
│  (Primary)  │
└─────────────┘
```

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

```bash
# Set up Kubernetes cluster
kubectl create namespace production

# Deploy Redis
helm install redis bitnami/redis \
    --set auth.password=$REDIS_PASSWORD \
    --set replica.replicaCount=3
```

### Phase 2: Application Changes

```python
# Before: Direct database queries
def get_user(user_id):
    return db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", user_id)

# After: Cache-first approach
def get_user(user_id):
    # Try cache first
    cached = redis.get(f"user:{user_id}")
    if cached:
        return json.loads(cached)
    
    # Fallback to database
    user = db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", user_id)
    
    # Cache for 5 minutes
    redis.setex(f"user:{user_id}", 300, json.dumps(user))
    
    return user
```

### Phase 3: Monitoring

```python
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram

request_count = Counter('requests_total', 'Total requests')
request_duration = Histogram('request_duration_seconds', 'Request duration')

@app.route('/api/data')
@request_duration.time()
def get_data():
    request_count.inc()
    return fetch_data()
```

## Results

### Performance Improvements

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| P50 Latency | 800ms | 95ms | -88% |
| P99 Latency | 3.2s | 250ms | -92% |
| Throughput | 100 req/s | 5000 req/s | +4900% |
| Error Rate | 2.5% | 0.1% | -96% |

### Cost Analysis

- Infrastructure cost increased by 40%
- Revenue increased by 200%
- Cost per user decreased by 50%

## Lessons Learned

1. **Measure First**: Extensive profiling revealed surprising bottlenecks
2. **Iterate Quickly**: We deployed incrementally over 3 months
3. **Monitor Everything**: Metrics were crucial for optimization
4. **Team Alignment**: Regular syncs kept everyone informed

## Challenges

### Cache Invalidation

Cache invalidation proved tricky. We implemented a pub/sub pattern:

```python
# Publisher (on data update)
def update_user(user_id, data):
    db.update("users", user_id, data)
    redis.publish('user_updates', json.dumps({
        'id': user_id,
        'action': 'update'
    }))

# Subscriber (cache invalidator)
def handle_update(message):
    data = json.loads(message)
    redis.delete(f"user:{data['id']}")
```

### Database Migration

Zero-downtime migration required careful planning:

1. Set up replication
2. Switch reads to replica
3. Migrate writes
4. Promote replica to primary

## Future Work

- Implement database sharding for further scaling
- Add CDN for static assets
- Explore serverless for batch jobs
- Improve observability with distributed tracing

## Conclusion

This project significantly improved our platform's performance and reliability.
The key was methodical planning, incremental rollout, and comprehensive monitoring.

# Deep Nesting Example

## Introduction to Meta-Documentation

This demonstrates documentation about documentation about documentation.

## Level 1: Basic Documentation

A simple example:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Level 2: Documenting Documentation

Showing how to write documentation:

````markdown
To include code in your docs:

```python
def example():
    pass
```
````

## Level 3: Meta-Meta-Documentation

Documenting how to document documentation:

`````markdown
Here's how to show documentation examples:

````markdown
To include code in your docs:

```python
def example():
    pass
```
````
`````

## Level 4: Triple Meta

Documentation about documenting documentation documentation:

``````markdown
Example of meta-meta-documentation:

`````markdown
Here's how to show documentation examples:

````markdown
To include code in your docs:

```python
def example():
    pass
```
````
`````
``````

## Practical Application

This level of nesting is useful for:

- Style guide documentation
- Documentation framework tutorials
- Markdown processor testing
- Template creation guides

## Real Example: Style Guide

``````markdown
# Documentation Style Guide

## Code Examples Section

Use this pattern for code examples:

`````markdown
### Example: Python Function

````markdown
Include the explanation first:

```python
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    """Add two numbers."""
    return a + b
```

Then show the usage.
````
`````
``````

The sextuple backticks (6 backticks) close the outermost fence correctly.

# How to Write Technical Documentation

A comprehensive guide for creating effective markdown documentation.

## Getting Started

Technical documentation should be clear, concise, and well-structured.

## Including Code Examples

### Basic Code Blocks

Use triple backticks for simple code:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

### Showing Markdown Examples

When documenting markdown syntax itself, use quadruple backticks:

````markdown
To create a header:

# Main Title
## Subsection
### Detail Level
````

### Meta-Documentation Pattern

For tutorials about writing documentation:

`````markdown
# Documentation Best Practices

## Code Example Section

Show code with context:

````markdown
First explain the concept, then show:

```python
# Implementation
def process():
    return "result"
```
````
`````

## Real-World Tutorial Example

````markdown
# Python Tutorial: Functions

## Defining Functions

Use the `def` keyword:

```python
def greet(name):
    """Return a greeting message."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

## Calling Functions

```python
message = greet("Alice")
print(message)  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```
````

## README Template

Here's a template for README files:

`````markdown
# Project Name

## Installation

```bash
pip install project-name
```

## Quick Start

```python
import project

# Basic usage
result = project.run()
```

## Advanced Usage

For complex scenarios:

````markdown
### Custom Configuration

```python
config = {
    'option1': 'value1',
    'option2': 'value2'
}
project.run(config)
```
````
`````

## Style Guide

When creating style guides, use nested fences to show examples:

````markdown
### Code Documentation

All functions must have docstrings:

```python
def calculate(x, y):
    """
    Calculate the sum of two numbers.
    
    Args:
        x: First number
        y: Second number
    
    Returns:
        Sum of x and y
    """
    return x + y

# Mixed Fence Types Documentation

## Overview

This document demonstrates mixing backtick and tilde fences in the same document.

## Backtick Fences Containing Tildes

When documenting tilde-based examples using backticks:

````markdown
Here's how to use tilde fences:

~~~bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Script using tilde fences"
ls -la
~~~
````

## Tilde Fences Containing Backticks

When documenting backtick-based examples using tildes:

~~~~markdown
Here's how to use backtick fences:

```python
def process_data(items):
    """Process a list of items."""
    return [item.strip() for item in items]
```
~~~~

## Real-World Use Case

A tutorial showing both fence types:

````markdown
### Option 1: Using Backticks

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

### Option 2: Using Tildes

~~~javascript
const farewell = "Goodbye!";
console.log(farewell);
~~~
````

## Alternating Examples

First example with backticks:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from Go")
}
```

Second example with tildes:

~~~rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello from Rust");
}
~~~

Both fence types work seamlessly together.

# How to Write Technical Documentation

## Including Code Examples

When documenting code, you need to show examples in markdown.

### Basic Code Block

Use triple backticks:

```markdown
Here's how to show Python:

```python
def hello():
    print('Hello, World!')
```
```

### Nested Examples

For meta-documentation:

````markdown
To show markdown within markdown:

```markdown
# Example
```python
code here
```
```
````

## Best Practices

1. Use appropriate fence depth
2. Specify language for syntax highlighting
3. Keep examples concise
4. Test all code examples

## Alternatives

You can also use tilde fences:

~~~python
def alternative():
    return True
~~~

# Tilde Fencing Guide

## Introduction

This guide demonstrates the use of tilde fencing as an alternative to backticks in markdown.

## Basic Tilde Fencing

Use triple tildes for standard code blocks:

~~~python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Call the function
result = greet("World")
print(result)
~~~

## Nested Tilde Fencing

For documentation that shows tilde-fenced examples:

~~~~markdown
To display Python code with tildes:

~~~python
def calculate_area(radius):
    import math
    return math.pi * radius ** 2
~~~
~~~~

## Mixed Content Example

Combining text and tilde-fenced code:

~~~javascript
function factorial(n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

console.log(factorial(5));  // Output: 120
~~~

The recursive approach is elegant but may cause stack overflow for large values.

# Research Notes: Database Theory Study

## Abstract

This document summarizes research findings on database theory 
optimization techniques. We investigate novel approaches and 
compare them with existing baselines.

## Literature Review

### Key Papers

1. Smith et al. (2023) - "Advanced Techniques in Database Theory"
2. Jones & Brown (2022) - "Optimization Strategies"
3. Lee et al. (2021) - "Benchmark Analysis"

### Related Work

Previous studies have shown that traditional approaches have 
limitations. Our work builds on [Smith2023] and extends it
with new methodologies.

## Methodology

### Experimental Setup

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Configuration
config = {
    'dataset_size': 10000,
    'test_split': 0.2,
    'random_seed': 42
}

# Load and prepare data
data = load_dataset(config['dataset_size'])
train, test = split_data(data, config['test_split'])
```

### Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Our Approach | Improvement |
|--------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Accuracy | 0.85 | 0.92 | +8.2% |
| Latency | 150ms | 95ms | -36.7% |
| Memory | 2GB | 1.2GB | -40% |

## Results

### Primary Findings

Our approach demonstrates significant improvements:

```python
# Results analysis
results = {
    'accuracy': 0.92,
    'precision': 0.89,
    'recall': 0.94,
    'f1_score': 0.91
}

print(f"F1 Score: {results['f1_score']:.2f}")
```

### Statistical Significance

- p-value < 0.01 for all metrics
- 95% confidence intervals shown in Table 1
- Reproducible across 10 independent runs

## Discussion

The results indicate that our approach is superior to baselines
in most scenarios. However, edge cases require further investigation.

### Limitations

1. Dataset size limited to 10K samples
2. Single domain evaluation
3. Computational cost for training

## Conclusions

This research demonstrates feasibility of the proposed approach.
Future work will address current limitations and explore
additional domains.

Essential formulas from differential and integral calculus.

## 1. Limits and Continuity

### 1.1 Definition of Limit

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L \iff \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 : 0 < |x-a| < \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - L| < \epsilon
$$

### 1.2 Important Limits

**Fundamental limits:**
$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1 - \cos x}{x^2} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^x - 1}{x} = 1
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\ln(1+x)}{x} = 1
$$

**Euler's number:**
$$
e = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n = \lim_{x \to 0} (1+x)^{1/x}
$$

### 1.3 L'Hôpital's Rule

If $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} g(x) = 0$ or $\pm\infty$:
$$
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}
$$

---

## 2. Derivatives

### 2.1 Definition

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

### 2.2 Basic Rules

**Sum rule:**
$$
(f + g)' = f' + g'
$$

**Product rule:**
$$
(fg)' = f'g + fg'
$$

**Quotient rule:**
$$
\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)' = \frac{f'g - fg'}{g^2}
$$

**Chain rule:**
$$
(f \circ g)'(x) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)
$$

### 2.3 Common Derivatives

| Function | Derivative |
|----------|------------|
| $x^n$ | $nx^{n-1}$ |
| $e^x$ | $e^x$ |
| $\ln x$ | $\frac{1}{x}$ |
| $\sin x$ | $\cos x$ |
| $\cos x$ | $-\sin x$ |
| $\tan x$ | $\sec^2 x$ |

### 2.4 Implicit Differentiation

For $F(x, y) = 0$:
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{\partial F/\partial x}{\partial F/\partial y} = -\frac{F_x}{F_y}
$$

## 3. Taylor Series

### 3.1 Taylor Expansion

$$
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n
$$

**Maclaurin series** (Taylor at $a=0$):
$$
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n
$$

### 3.2 Common Expansions

$$
e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!} = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots
$$

$$
\sin x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!} = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \cdots
$$

$$
\cos x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n}}{(2n)!} = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \cdots
$$

$$
\ln(1+x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1} x^n}{n} = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots
$$

### 3.3 Remainder Term

Lagrange form:
$$
R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(\xi)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}
$$

for some $\xi$ between $a$ and $x$.

$$
\int u\,dv = uv - \int v\,du
$$

**Substitution:**
$$
\int f(g(x))g'(x)\,dx = \int f(u)\,du
$$

### 4.4 Common Integrals

$$
\int x^n \, dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C, \quad n \neq -1
$$

$$
\int e^x \, dx = e^x + C
$$

$$
\int \frac{1}{x} \, dx = \ln|x| + C
$$

$$
\int \sin x \, dx = -\cos x + C
$$

$$
\int \frac{1}{1+x^2} \, dx = \arctan x + C
$$

$$
\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \, dx = \arcsin x + C
$$

# Machine Learning Mathematical Foundations

This document covers essential mathematical equations used in machine learning, including distance measures, loss functions, and generative model formulations.

## 1. Distance Measures

### 1.1 Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL-Divergence)

KL-Divergence measures how one probability distribution diverges from a second expected probability distribution:

$$
KL(P||Q) = \sum_{x} P(x) \log\left(\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\right)
$$

For continuous distributions:

$$
KL(P||Q) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \log\left(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\right) dx
$$

**Properties:**
- Non-negative: $KL(P||Q) \geq 0$
- Asymmetric: $KL(P||Q) \neq KL(Q||P)$
- Zero iff $P = Q$

### 1.2 Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JS-Divergence)

A symmetric version of KL-Divergence:

$$
JS(P||Q) = \frac{1}{2}KL\left(P||\frac{P+Q}{2}\right) + \frac{1}{2}KL\left(Q||\frac{P+Q}{2}\right)
$$

This is bounded: $0 \leq JS(P||Q) \leq \log 2$

### 1.3 Wasserstein Distance (Optimal Transport)

Also known as Earth Mover's Distance:

$$
W_{p}(P,Q) = \left(\inf_{J \in \mathcal{J}(P,Q)} \int ||x-y||^{p} dJ(x,y)\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}
$$

For $p=1$, this simplifies to:

$$
W_1(P,Q) = \inf_{\gamma \in \Pi(P,Q)} \mathbb{E}_{(x,y) \sim \gamma}[||x - y||]
$$

### 1.4 Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)

A kernel-based distance measure:

$$
\text{MMD}(\mathcal{F}, X, Y) := \sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \left(\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} f(x_i) - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n} f(y_j)\right)
$$

With kernel $k$:

$$
\text{MMD}^2 = \mathbb{E}[k(x,x')] - 2\mathbb{E}[k(x,y)] + \mathbb{E}[k(y,y')]
$$

### 1.5 Mahalanobis Distance

Distance accounting for correlations in the data:

$$
D_M(x, y) = \sqrt{(x-y)^T \Sigma^{-1} (x-y)}
$$

where $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix.

---

## 2. Generative Models

### 2.1 Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

# Neural Network Backpropagation: A Mathematical Treatment

## Abstract

This document provides a rigorous mathematical derivation of the backpropagation algorithm for training feedforward neural networks. We cover the chain rule application, gradient computation, and common activation functions.

## 1. Introduction

Neural networks learn by adjusting weights to minimize a loss function. The backpropagation algorithm efficiently computes gradients of the loss with respect to each weight using the chain rule of calculus.

Consider a network with $L$ layers, where layer $l$ has weights $W^{(l)}$ and biases $b^{(l)}$.

## 2. Forward Propagation

### 2.1 Layer Computations

For each layer $l = 1, \ldots, L$:

**Pre-activation:**
$$
z^{(l)} = W^{(l)} a^{(l-1)} + b^{(l)}
$$

**Activation:**
$$
a^{(l)} = \sigma(z^{(l)})
$$

where $a^{(0)} = x$ (input) and $\sigma$ is the activation function.

### 2.2 Activation Functions

**Sigmoid:**
$$
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}, \quad \sigma'(z) = \sigma(z)(1 - \sigma(z))
$$

**Tanh:**
$$
\tanh(z) = \frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{e^z + e^{-z}}, \quad \tanh'(z) = 1 - \tanh^2(z)
$$

**ReLU:**
$$
\text{ReLU}(z) = \max(0, z), \quad \text{ReLU}'(z) = \begin{cases} 1 & z > 0 \\ 0 & z \leq 0 \end{cases}
$$

**Leaky ReLU:**
$$
\text{LeakyReLU}(z) = \begin{cases} z & z > 0 \\ \alpha z & z \leq 0 \end{cases}
$$

**Softmax** (for output layer):
$$
\text{softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j}}
$$

**GELU:**
$$
\text{GELU}(x) = x \cdot \Phi(x) = x \cdot \frac{1}{2}\left[1 + \text{erf}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\right]
$$

## 3. Loss Functions

### 3.1 Mean Squared Error

For regression:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{MSE} = \frac{1}{2N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}||y_i - \hat{y}_i||^2
$$

Gradient with respect to output:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{MSE}}{\partial \hat{y}} = \hat{y} - y
$$

### 3.2 Cross-Entropy Loss

For classification with softmax output:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{CE} = -\sum_{c=1}^{C} y_c \log(\hat{y}_c)
$$

Combined gradient (cross-entropy + softmax):
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{CE}}{\partial z_i} = \hat{y}_i - y_i
$$

## 4. Backpropagation Algorithm

### 4.1 Output Layer Error

Define the error signal at layer $l$:
$$
\delta^{(l)} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial z^{(l)}}
$$

For the output layer $L$:
$$
\delta^{(L)} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial a^{(L)}} \odot \sigma'(z^{(L)})
$$

### 4.2 Hidden Layer Errors

For layers $l = L-1, \ldots, 1$:
$$
\delta^{(l)} = (W^{(l+1)})^T \delta^{(l+1)} \odot \sigma'(z^{(l)})
$$

### 4.3 Gradient Computation

**Weight gradients:**
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{(l)}} = \delta^{(l)} (a^{(l-1)})^T
$$

**Bias gradients:**
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b^{(l)}} = \delta^{(l)}
$$

### 4.4 Batch Gradient

For a mini-batch of $m$ samples:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{(l)}} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} \delta_i^{(l)} (a_i^{(l-1)})^T
$$

## 5. Optimization

### 5.1 Stochastic Gradient Descent

$$
W_{t+1} = W_t - \eta \nabla_W \mathcal{L}
$$

### 5.2 Momentum

$$
v_{t+1} = \gamma v_t + \eta \nabla_W \mathcal{L}
$$

$$
W_{t+1} = W_t - v_{t+1}
$$

### 5.3 Adam Optimizer

\begin{align}
m_t &= \beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_1) g_t \\
v_t &= \beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_2) g_t^2 \\
\hat{m}_t &= \frac{m_t}{1 - \beta_1^t} \\
\hat{v}_t &= \frac{v_t}{1 - \beta_2^t} \\
W_{t+1} &= W_t - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{\hat{v}_t} + \epsilon} \hat{m}_t
\end{align}

Default hyperparameters: $\beta_1 = 0.9$, $\beta_2 = 0.999$, $\epsilon = 10^{-8}$

## 6. Regularization

### 6.1 L2 Regularization (Weight Decay)

$$
\mathcal{L}_{reg} = \mathcal{L} + \frac{\lambda}{2}\sum_l ||W^{(l)}||_F^2
$$

Gradient modification:
$$
\nabla_{W^{(l)}} \mathcal{L}_{reg} = \nabla_{W^{(l)}} \mathcal{L} + \lambda W^{(l)}
$$

### 6.2 Dropout

During training, randomly set activations to zero:
$$
\tilde{a}^{(l)} = \frac{1}{1-p} \cdot a^{(l)} \odot m^{(l)}
$$

where $m^{(l)} \sim \text{Bernoulli}(1-p)$ and $p$ is dropout rate.

### 6.3 Batch Normalization

For mini-batch $\mathcal{B} = \{x_1, \ldots, x_m\}$:

\begin{align}
\mu_\mathcal{B} &= \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i \\
\sigma_\mathcal{B}^2 &= \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(x_i - \mu_\mathcal{B})^2 \\
\hat{x}_i &= \frac{x_i - \mu_\mathcal{B}}{\sqrt{\sigma_\mathcal{B}^2 + \epsilon}} \\
y_i &= \gamma \hat{x}_i + \beta
\end{align}

## 7. Weight Initialization

### 7.1 Xavier/Glorot Initialization

For layer with $n_{in}$ inputs and $n_{out}$ outputs:
$$
W \sim \mathcal{U}\left(-\sqrt{\frac{6}{n_{in} + n_{out}}}, \sqrt{\frac{6}{n_{in} + n_{out}}}\right)
$$

or with normal distribution:
$$
W \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \frac{2}{n_{in} + n_{out}}\right)
$$

### 7.2 He Initialization

For ReLU networks:
$$
W \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \frac{2}{n_{in}}\right)
$$

## 8. Convolutional Layers

### 8.1 Convolution Operation

For input $X$ and kernel $K$:
$$
(X * K)_{ij} = \sum_{m}\sum_{n} X_{i+m, j+n} K_{m,n}
$$

### 8.2 Output Size

For input size $W$, kernel size $K$, padding $P$, and stride $S$:
$$
W_{out} = \left\lfloor \frac{W - K + 2P}{S} \right\rfloor + 1
$$

### 8.3 Backpropagation Through Convolution

Gradient with respect to input:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial X} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial Y} * K^{rot180}
$$

Gradient with respect to kernel:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial K} = X * \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial Y}
$$

## 9. Recurrent Layers

### 9.1 Simple RNN

$$
h_t = \tanh(W_{hh} h_{t-1} + W_{xh} x_t + b_h)
$$

$$
y_t = W_{hy} h_t + b_y
$$

h_t &= o_t \odot \tanh(C_t) \quad \text{(hidden state)}
\end{align}

### 9.3 GRU

r_t &= \sigma(W_r \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t]) \quad \text{(reset gate)} \\
\tilde{h}_t &= \tanh(W \cdot [r_t \odot h_{t-1}, x_t]) \\
h_t &= (1 - z_t) \odot h_{t-1} + z_t \odot \tilde{h}_t
\end{align}

## 10. Attention Mechanism

### 10.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

### 10.2 Multi-Head Attention

$$
\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \ldots, \text{head}_h)W^O
$$

where:
$$
\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)
$$

## Conclusion

Backpropagation enables efficient gradient computation in neural networks by applying the chain rule systematically from output to input layers. Combined with optimization algorithms like Adam and regularization techniques, it forms the foundation of modern deep learning.

\phi(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-z^2/2}
$$

**Exponential Distribution:**
$$
f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, \quad x \geq 0
$$

**Chi-Square Distribution:**
$$
f(x; k) = \frac{x^{k/2-1} e^{-x/2}}{2^{k/2} \Gamma(k/2)}, \quad x > 0
$$

**Student's t-Distribution:**
$$
f(t) = \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{
u+1}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{
u\pi}\,\Gamma\left(\frac{
u}{2}\right)} \left(1 + \frac{t^2}{
u}\right)^{-\frac{
u+1}{2}}
$$

**F-Distribution:**
$$
f(x; d_1, d_2) = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{(d_1 x)^{d_1} d_2^{d_2}}{(d_1 x + d_2)^{d_1+d_2}}}}{x \cdot B\left(\frac{d_1}{2}, \frac{d_2}{2}\right)}
$$

---

## 3. Hypothesis Testing

### 3.1 Z-Test

Test statistic:
$$
z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}
$$

### 3.2 T-Test

**One-sample t-test:**
$$
t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}
$$

**Two-sample t-test (pooled variance):**
$$
t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{s_p\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}}
$$

where pooled standard deviation:
$$
s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}
$$

### 3.3 Chi-Square Test

$$
\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}
$$

### 3.4 F-Test

$$
F = \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2}
$$

---

## 4. Confidence Intervals

### 4.1 For Population Mean

When $\sigma$ is known:
$$
\bar{x} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

When $\sigma$ is unknown:
$$
\bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-1} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

### 4.2 For Population Proportion

$$
\hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}
$$

---

## 5. Regression Analysis

### 5.1 Simple Linear Regression

Model: $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon$

**Least Squares Estimators:**
$$
\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2} = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}
$$

$$
\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x}
$$

### 5.2 Coefficient of Determination

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}} = 1 - \frac{\sum(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum(y_i - \bar{y})^2}
$$

### 5.3 Multiple Linear Regression

In matrix form:
$$
\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} = (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{y}
$$

---

## 6. Correlation

### 6.1 Pearson Correlation Coefficient

$$
r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
$$

Or equivalently:
$$
r = \frac{n\sum x_i y_i - \sum x_i \sum y_i}{\sqrt{n\sum x_i^2 - (\sum x_i)^2}\sqrt{n\sum y_i^2 - (\sum y_i)^2}}
$$

### 6.2 Spearman Rank Correlation

$$
\rho = 1 - \frac{6\sum d_i^2}{n(n^2-1)}
$$

where $d_i = \text{rank}(x_i) - \text{rank}(y_i)$

---

## 7. Bayesian Statistics

### 7.1 Bayes' Theorem

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

For continuous parameters:
$$
p(\theta|x) = \frac{p(x|\theta) \cdot p(\theta)}{p(x)} = \frac{p(x|\theta) \cdot p(\theta)}{\int p(x|\theta) p(\theta) d\theta}
$$

### 7.2 Posterior Predictive Distribution

$$
p(\tilde{x}|x) = \int p(\tilde{x}|\theta) p(\theta|x) d\theta
$$

---

## 8. Maximum Likelihood Estimation

### 8.1 Likelihood Function

$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i|\theta)
$$

### 8.2 Log-Likelihood

$$
\ell(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log f(x_i|\theta)
$$

### 8.3 MLE Condition

$$
\frac{\partial \ell(\theta)}{\partial \theta} = 0
$$

### 8.4 Fisher Information

$$
I(\theta) = -\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{\partial^2 \ell(\theta)}{\partial \theta^2}\right]
$$

Cramér-Rao Lower Bound:
$$
\text{Var}(\hat{\theta}) \geq \frac{1}{n \cdot I(\theta)}
$$

# Debugging Data Corruption in Node.js Application

## Symptoms

- incorrect data in database
- Eventually leads to system failure
- Occurs under high load conditions

## Environment

- Node.js version: latest
- OS: Linux
- Load: 1000+ requests/second

## Code Under Investigation

```javascript
// Main application code
function processRequest(req) {
    const data = fetchData(req.id);
    const result = transformData(data);
    cache[req.id] = result;  // Potential issue here
    return result;
}
```

## Diagnostic Output

```
Memory Usage Timeline:
T+0min:  512MB
T+10min: 1.2GB
T+20min: 2.5GB
T+30min: 4.1GB (OOM kill)
```

## Heap Analysis

```
Top Memory Consumers:
Object Type      | Count  | Size
-----------------|--------|--------
CachedData       | 50000  | 2.1GB
RequestContext   | 30000  | 800MB
ConnectionPool   | 500    | 50MB
```

## Root Cause

The cache grows unbounded because there's no eviction policy.

## Solution

Implemented LRU cache with size limits:

```javascript
// Fixed implementation
const LRU = require('lru-cache');
const cache = new LRU({
    max: 1000,
    maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 5  // 5 minutes
});

function processRequest(req) {
    const data = fetchData(req.id);
    const result = transformData(data);
    cache.set(req.id, result);
    return result;
}
```

## Verification

After fix:
- Memory stable at ~600MB
- No OOM kills in 7 days
- Performance improved 20%

## Lessons

1. Always set limits on caches
2. Monitor memory usage
3. Use profiling tools early
4. Test under realistic load

# Migrating Our Infrastructure: monolith to microservices architecture

*Posted on December 06, 2025 by Engineering Team*

## Introduction

Over the past year, our platform has experienced tremendous growth. This post 
details our journey migrating monolith to microservices architecture.

## The Challenge

As our user base grew from 10K to 1M+ users, we faced several challenges:

- **Performance**: Response times increased to 2-3 seconds
- **Scalability**: Single server couldn't handle peak load
- **Reliability**: Downtime during deployments
- **Cost**: Infrastructure costs growing faster than revenue

## Initial Architecture

Our original setup:

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Client    │
└─────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  Web Server │
│  (Single)   │
└─────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  PostgreSQL │
│  (Primary)  │
└─────────────┘
```

## Solution Design

After extensive research and prototyping, we designed a new architecture:

```
┌─────────────┐
│Load Balancer│
└─────────────┘
       │
    ┌──┴──┐
    ▼     ▼
┌─────┐ ┌─────┐
│Web-1│ │Web-2│ ...
└─────┘ └─────┘
    │     │
    └──┬──┘
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   Redis     │
│   Cache     │
└─────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  PostgreSQL │
│  (Primary)  │
└─────────────┘
```

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

```bash
# Set up Kubernetes cluster
kubectl create namespace production

# Deploy Redis
helm install redis bitnami/redis \
    --set auth.password=$REDIS_PASSWORD \
    --set replica.replicaCount=3
```

### Phase 2: Application Changes

```python
# Before: Direct database queries
def get_user(user_id):
    return db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", user_id)

# After: Cache-first approach
def get_user(user_id):
    # Try cache first
    cached = redis.get(f"user:{user_id}")
    if cached:
        return json.loads(cached)
    
    # Fallback to database
    user = db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", user_id)
    
    # Cache for 5 minutes
    redis.setex(f"user:{user_id}", 300, json.dumps(user))
    
    return user
```

### Phase 3: Monitoring

```python
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram

request_count = Counter('requests_total', 'Total requests')
request_duration = Histogram('request_duration_seconds', 'Request duration')

@app.route('/api/data')
@request_duration.time()
def get_data():
    request_count.inc()
    return fetch_data()
```

## Results

### Performance Improvements

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| P50 Latency | 800ms | 95ms | -88% |
| P99 Latency | 3.2s | 250ms | -92% |
| Throughput | 100 req/s | 5000 req/s | +4900% |
| Error Rate | 2.5% | 0.1% | -96% |

### Cost Analysis

- Infrastructure cost increased by 40%
- Revenue increased by 200%
- Cost per user decreased by 50%

## Lessons Learned

1. **Measure First**: Extensive profiling revealed surprising bottlenecks
2. **Iterate Quickly**: We deployed incrementally over 3 months
3. **Monitor Everything**: Metrics were crucial for optimization
4. **Team Alignment**: Regular syncs kept everyone informed

## Challenges

### Cache Invalidation

Cache invalidation proved tricky. We implemented a pub/sub pattern:

```python
# Publisher (on data update)
def update_user(user_id, data):
    db.update("users", user_id, data)
    redis.publish('user_updates', json.dumps({
        'id': user_id,
        'action': 'update'
    }))

# Subscriber (cache invalidator)
def handle_update(message):
    data = json.loads(message)
    redis.delete(f"user:{data['id']}")
```

### Database Migration

Zero-downtime migration required careful planning:

1. Set up replication
2. Switch reads to replica
3. Migrate writes
4. Promote replica to primary

## Future Work

- Implement database sharding for further scaling
- Add CDN for static assets
- Explore serverless for batch jobs
- Improve observability with distributed tracing

## Conclusion

This project significantly improved our platform's performance and reliability.
The key was methodical planning, incremental rollout, and comprehensive monitoring.

``````

## Practical Application

This level of nesting is useful for:

- Style guide documentation
- Documentation framework tutorials
- Markdown processor testing
- Template creation guides

## Real Example: Style Guide

``````markdown
# Documentation Style Guide

## Code Examples Section

Use this pattern for code examples:

`````markdown
### Example: Python Function

````markdown
Include the explanation first:

```python
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    """Add two numbers."""
    return a + b
```

Then show the usage.
````
`````
``````

The sextuple backticks (6 backticks) close the outermost fence correctly.

# How to Write Technical Documentation

A comprehensive guide for creating effective markdown documentation.

## Getting Started

Technical documentation should be clear, concise, and well-structured.

## Including Code Examples

### Basic Code Blocks

Use triple backticks for simple code:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

### Showing Markdown Examples

When documenting markdown syntax itself, use quadruple backticks:

````markdown
To create a header:

# Main Title
## Subsection
### Detail Level
````

### Meta-Documentation Pattern

For tutorials about writing documentation:

`````markdown
# Documentation Best Practices

## Code Example Section

Show code with context:

````markdown
First explain the concept, then show:

```python
# Implementation
def process():
    return "result"
```
````
`````

## Real-World Tutorial Example

````markdown
# Python Tutorial: Functions

## Defining Functions

Use the `def` keyword:

```python
def greet(name):
    """Return a greeting message."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

## Calling Functions

```python
message = greet("Alice")
print(message)  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```
````

## README Template

Here's a template for README files:

`````markdown
# Project Name

## Installation

```bash
pip install project-name
```

## Quick Start

```python
import project

# Basic usage
result = project.run()
```

## Advanced Usage

For complex scenarios:

````markdown
### Custom Configuration

```python
config = {
    'option1': 'value1',
    'option2': 'value2'
}
project.run(config)
```
````
`````

## Style Guide

When creating style guides, use nested fences to show examples:

````markdown
### Code Documentation

All functions must have docstrings:

```python
def calculate(x, y):
    """
    Calculate the sum of two numbers.
    
    Args:
        x: First number
        y: Second number
    
    Returns:
        Sum of x and y
    """
    return x + y
```
````

## Conclusion

Nested fencing enables clear, unambiguous documentation about markdown syntax itself.

# Mixed Fence Types Documentation

## Overview

This document demonstrates mixing backtick and tilde fences in the same document.

## Backtick Fences Containing Tildes

When documenting tilde-based examples using backticks:

````markdown
Here's how to use tilde fences:

~~~bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Script using tilde fences"
ls -la
~~~
````

## Tilde Fences Containing Backticks

When documenting backtick-based examples using tildes:

~~~~markdown
Here's how to use backtick fences:

```python
def process_data(items):
    """Process a list of items."""
    return [item.strip() for item in items]
```
~~~~

## Real-World Use Case

A tutorial showing both fence types:

````markdown
### Option 1: Using Backticks

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

### Option 2: Using Tildes

~~~javascript
const farewell = "Goodbye!";
console.log(farewell);
~~~
````

## Alternating Examples

First example with backticks:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from Go")
}
```

Second example with tildes:

~~~rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello from Rust");
}
~~~

Both fence types work seamlessly together.

# How to Write Technical Documentation

## Including Code Examples

When documenting code, you need to show examples in markdown.

### Basic Code Block

Use triple backticks:

```markdown
Here's how to show Python:

```python
def hello():
    print('Hello, World!')
```
```

### Nested Examples

For meta-documentation:

````markdown
To show markdown within markdown:

```markdown
# Example
```python
code here
```
```
````

## Best Practices

1. Use appropriate fence depth
2. Specify language for syntax highlighting
3. Keep examples concise
4. Test all code examples

## Alternatives

You can also use tilde fences:

~~~python
def alternative():
    return True
~~~

# Tilde Fencing Guide

## Introduction

This guide demonstrates the use of tilde fencing as an alternative to backticks in markdown.

## Basic Tilde Fencing

Use triple tildes for standard code blocks:

~~~python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Call the function
result = greet("World")
print(result)
~~~

## Nested Tilde Fencing

For documentation that shows tilde-fenced examples:

~~~~markdown
To display Python code with tildes:

~~~python
def calculate_area(radius):
    import math
    return math.pi * radius ** 2
~~~
~~~~

## Mixed Content Example

Combining text and tilde-fenced code:

~~~javascript
function factorial(n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

console.log(factorial(5));  // Output: 120
~~~

The recursive approach is elegant but may cause stack overflow for large values.

# Research Notes: Database Theory Study

## Abstract

This document summarizes research findings on database theory 
optimization techniques. We investigate novel approaches and 
compare them with existing baselines.

## Literature Review

### Key Papers

1. Smith et al. (2023) - "Advanced Techniques in Database Theory"
2. Jones & Brown (2022) - "Optimization Strategies"
3. Lee et al. (2021) - "Benchmark Analysis"

### Related Work

Previous studies have shown that traditional approaches have 
limitations. Our work builds on [Smith2023] and extends it
with new methodologies.

## Methodology

### Experimental Setup

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Configuration
config = {
    'dataset_size': 10000,
    'test_split': 0.2,
    'random_seed': 42
}

# Load and prepare data
data = load_dataset(config['dataset_size'])
train, test = split_data(data, config['test_split'])
```

### Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Our Approach | Improvement |
|--------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Accuracy | 0.85 | 0.92 | +8.2% |
| Latency | 150ms | 95ms | -36.7% |
| Memory | 2GB | 1.2GB | -40% |

## Results

### Primary Findings

Our approach demonstrates significant improvements:

```python
# Results analysis
results = {
    'accuracy': 0.92,
    'precision': 0.89,
    'recall': 0.94,
    'f1_score': 0.91
}

print(f"F1 Score: {results['f1_score']:.2f}")
```

### Statistical Significance

- Reproducible across 10 independent runs

## Discussion

The results indicate that our approach is superior to baselines
in most scenarios. However, edge cases require further investigation.

### Limitations

## 1. Limits and Continuity

### 1.1 Definition of Limit

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L \iff \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 : 0 < |x-a| < \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - L| < \epsilon
$$

### 1.2 Important Limits

**Fundamental limits:**
$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1 - \cos x}{x^2} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^x - 1}{x} = 1
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\ln(1+x)}{x} = 1
$$

**Euler's number:**
$$
e = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n = \lim_{x \to 0} (1+x)^{1/x}
$$

### 1.3 L'Hôpital's Rule

If $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} g(x) = 0$ or $\pm\infty$:
$$
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}
$$

---

## 2. Derivatives

$$

### 2.2 Basic Rules

**Sum rule:**

(f + g)' = f' + g'
$$

**Product rule:**
$$
(fg)' = f'g + fg'
$$

**Quotient rule:**
$$
\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)' = \frac{f'g - fg'}{g^2}
$$

**Chain rule:**
$$
(f \circ g)'(x) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)
$$

### 2.3 Common Derivatives

| Function | Derivative |

$$

$$
\sin x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!} = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \cdots
$$

$$
\cos x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n}}{(2n)!} = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \cdots
$$

$$
\ln(1+x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1} x^n}{n} = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots
$$

### 3.3 Remainder Term

# Machine Learning Mathematical Foundations

This document covers essential mathematical equations used in machine learning, including distance measures, loss functions, and generative model formulations.

## 1. Distance Measures

### 1.1 Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL-Divergence)

KL-Divergence measures how one probability distribution diverges from a second expected probability distribution:

$$
KL(P||Q) = \sum_{x} P(x) \log\left(\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\right)
$$

For continuous distributions:

$$
KL(P||Q) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \log\left(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\right) dx
$$

**Properties:**
- Non-negative: $KL(P||Q) \geq 0$
- Asymmetric: $KL(P||Q) \neq KL(Q||P)$
- Zero iff $P = Q$

### 1.2 Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JS-Divergence)

A symmetric version of KL-Divergence:

$$
JS(P||Q) = \frac{1}{2}KL\left(P||\frac{P+Q}{2}\right) + \frac{1}{2}KL\left(Q||\frac{P+Q}{2}\right)
$$

This is bounded: $0 \leq JS(P||Q) \leq \log 2$

### 1.3 Wasserstein Distance (Optimal Transport)

Also known as Earth Mover's Distance:

$$
W_{p}(P,Q) = \left(\inf_{J \in \mathcal{J}(P,Q)} \int ||x-y||^{p} dJ(x,y)\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}
$$

For $p=1$, this simplifies to:

$$
W_1(P,Q) = \inf_{\gamma \in \Pi(P,Q)} \mathbb{E}_{(x,y) \sim \gamma}[||x - y||]
$$

### 1.4 Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)

A kernel-based distance measure:

$$
\text{MMD}(\mathcal{F}, X, Y) := \sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \left(\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} f(x_i) - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n} f(y_j)\right)
$$

With kernel $k$:

$$
\text{MMD}^2 = \mathbb{E}[k(x,x')] - 2\mathbb{E}[k(x,y)] + \mathbb{E}[k(y,y')]
$$

### 1.5 Mahalanobis Distance

Distance accounting for correlations in the data:

$$
D_M(x, y) = \sqrt{(x-y)^T \Sigma^{-1} (x-y)}
$$

where $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix.

---

## 2. Generative Models

### 2.1 Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

The minimax objective for GANs:

$$
\min_G \max_D V(D,G) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}(x)}[\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)}[\log(1-D(G(z)))]
$$

**Optimal discriminator:**

$$
D^*(x) = \frac{p_{data}(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)}
$$

**Generator loss (non-saturating):**

$$
\mathcal{L}_G = -\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)}[\log D(G(z))]
$$

### 2.2 Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)

#### Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\theta,\phi}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}[\log p_\theta(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z}) - \log q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})]
$$

Equivalently:

$$
\log p_\theta(\mathbf{x}) \geq \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}[\log p_\theta(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z})] - D_{KL}(q_\phi(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}) || p(\mathbf{z}))
$$

#### Reparameterization Trick

$$
\mathbf{z} = \boldsymbol{\mu} + \boldsymbol{\sigma} \odot \boldsymbol{\epsilon}, \quad \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)
$$

### 2.3 Diffusion Models (DDPM)

#### Forward Process

$$
q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t}x_{t-1}, \beta_t I)
$$

$$
q(x_{1:T}|x_0) = \prod_{t=1}^{T} q(x_t|x_{t-1})
$$

#### Reparameterization

$$
x_t = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t} \epsilon
$$

where $\alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t$ and $\bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{s=1}^{t} \alpha_s$

#### Reverse Process

$$
p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{0:T}) = p(\mathbf{x}_T) \prod_{t=1}^{T} p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}|\mathbf{x}_t)
$$

$$
p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}|\mathbf{x}_t) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}; \boldsymbol{\mu}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t), \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t))
$$

#### Training Objective

\begin{align}
L_{simple} &= \mathbb{E}_{t, x_0, \epsilon}\left[||\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)||^2\right]
\end{align}

$$
\mathcal{L}_{BCE} = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}[y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1-y_i)\log(1-\hat{y}_i)]
$$

For multi-class:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{CE} = -\sum_{c=1}^{C} y_c \log(\hat{y}_c)
$$

### 3.2 Mean Squared Error

$$
\mathcal{L}_{MSE} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$

### 3.3 Focal Loss

For handling class imbalance:

$$
FL(p_t) = -\alpha_t (1-p_t)^\gamma \log(p_t)
$$

## 4. Optimization

### 4.1 Gradient Descent

$$
\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta_t)
$$

### 4.2 Adam Optimizer

\begin{align}

# Neural Network Backpropagation: A Mathematical Treatment

## Abstract

This document provides a rigorous mathematical derivation of the backpropagation algorithm for training feedforward neural networks. We cover the chain rule application, gradient computation, and common activation functions.

## 1. Introduction

Neural networks learn by adjusting weights to minimize a loss function. The backpropagation algorithm efficiently computes gradients of the loss with respect to each weight using the chain rule of calculus.

Consider a network with $L$ layers, where layer $l$ has weights $W^{(l)}$ and biases $b^{(l)}$.

## 2. Forward Propagation

### 2.1 Layer Computations

For each layer $l = 1, \ldots, L$:

**Pre-activation:**
$$
z^{(l)} = W^{(l)} a^{(l-1)} + b^{(l)}
$$

**Activation:**
$$
a^{(l)} = \sigma(z^{(l)})
$$

where $a^{(0)} = x$ (input) and $\sigma$ is the activation function.

### 2.2 Activation Functions

**Sigmoid:**
$$
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}, \quad \sigma'(z) = \sigma(z)(1 - \sigma(z))
$$

**Tanh:**
$$
\tanh(z) = \frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{e^z + e^{-z}}, \quad \tanh'(z) = 1 - \tanh^2(z)
$$

**ReLU:**
$$
\text{ReLU}(z) = \max(0, z), \quad \text{ReLU}'(z) = \begin{cases} 1 & z > 0 \\ 0 & z \leq 0 \end{cases}
$$

**Leaky ReLU:**
$$
\text{LeakyReLU}(z) = \begin{cases} z & z > 0 \\ \alpha z & z \leq 0 \end{cases}
$$

**Softmax** (for output layer):
$$
\text{softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j}}
$$

**GELU:**
$$
\text{GELU}(x) = x \cdot \Phi(x) = x \cdot \frac{1}{2}\left[1 + \text{erf}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\right]
$$

## 3. Loss Functions

### 3.1 Mean Squared Error

For regression:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{MSE} = \frac{1}{2N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}||y_i - \hat{y}_i||^2
$$

Gradient with respect to output:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{MSE}}{\partial \hat{y}} = \hat{y} - y
$$

### 3.2 Cross-Entropy Loss

For classification with softmax output:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{CE} = -\sum_{c=1}^{C} y_c \log(\hat{y}_c)
$$

Combined gradient (cross-entropy + softmax):
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{CE}}{\partial z_i} = \hat{y}_i - y_i
$$

## 4. Backpropagation Algorithm

### 4.1 Output Layer Error

Define the error signal at layer $l$:
$$
\delta^{(l)} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial z^{(l)}}
$$

For the output layer $L$:
$$
\delta^{(L)} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial a^{(L)}} \odot \sigma'(z^{(L)})
$$

### 4.2 Hidden Layer Errors

For layers $l = L-1, \ldots, 1$:
$$
\delta^{(l)} = (W^{(l+1)})^T \delta^{(l+1)} \odot \sigma'(z^{(l)})
$$

### 4.3 Gradient Computation

**Weight gradients:**
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{(l)}} = \delta^{(l)} (a^{(l-1)})^T
$$

**Bias gradients:**
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b^{(l)}} = \delta^{(l)}
$$

### 4.4 Batch Gradient

For a mini-batch of $m$ samples:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{(l)}} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} \delta_i^{(l)} (a_i^{(l-1)})^T
$$

## 5. Optimization

### 5.1 Stochastic Gradient Descent

$$
W_{t+1} = W_t - \eta \nabla_W \mathcal{L}
$$

### 5.2 Momentum

$$
v_{t+1} = \gamma v_t + \eta \nabla_W \mathcal{L}
$$

$$
W_{t+1} = W_t - v_{t+1}
$$

### 5.3 Adam Optimizer

\begin{align}
m_t &= \beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_1) g_t \\
v_t &= \beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_2) g_t^2 \\
\hat{m}_t &= \frac{m_t}{1 - \beta_1^t} \\
\hat{v}_t &= \frac{v_t}{1 - \beta_2^t} \\
W_{t+1} &= W_t - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{\hat{v}_t} + \epsilon} \hat{m}_t
\end{align}

Default hyperparameters: $\beta_1 = 0.9$, $\beta_2 = 0.999$, $\epsilon = 10^{-8}$

## 6. Regularization

### 6.1 L2 Regularization (Weight Decay)

$$
\mathcal{L}_{reg} = \mathcal{L} + \frac{\lambda}{2}\sum_l ||W^{(l)}||_F^2
$$

Gradient modification:
$$
\nabla_{W^{(l)}} \mathcal{L}_{reg} = \nabla_{W^{(l)}} \mathcal{L} + \lambda W^{(l)}
$$

### 6.2 Dropout

During training, randomly set activations to zero:
$$
\tilde{a}^{(l)} = \frac{1}{1-p} \cdot a^{(l)} \odot m^{(l)}
$$

where $m^{(l)} \sim \text{Bernoulli}(1-p)$ and $p$ is dropout rate.

### 6.3 Batch Normalization

For mini-batch $\mathcal{B} = \{x_1, \ldots, x_m\}$:

\begin{align}
\mu_\mathcal{B} &= \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i \\
\sigma_\mathcal{B}^2 &= \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(x_i - \mu_\mathcal{B})^2 \\
\hat{x}_i &= \frac{x_i - \mu_\mathcal{B}}{\sqrt{\sigma_\mathcal{B}^2 + \epsilon}} \\
y_i &= \gamma \hat{x}_i + \beta
\end{align}

## 7. Weight Initialization

### 7.1 Xavier/Glorot Initialization

For layer with $n_{in}$ inputs and $n_{out}$ outputs:
$$
W \sim \mathcal{U}\left(-\sqrt{\frac{6}{n_{in} + n_{out}}}, \sqrt{\frac{6}{n_{in} + n_{out}}}\right)
$$

or with normal distribution:
$$
W \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \frac{2}{n_{in} + n_{out}}\right)
$$

### 7.2 He Initialization

For ReLU networks:
$$
W \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \frac{2}{n_{in}}\right)
$$

## 8. Convolutional Layers

### 8.1 Convolution Operation

For input $X$ and kernel $K$:
$$
(X * K)_{ij} = \sum_{m}\sum_{n} X_{i+m, j+n} K_{m,n}
$$

### 8.2 Output Size

For input size $W$, kernel size $K$, padding $P$, and stride $S$:
$$
W_{out} = \left\lfloor \frac{W - K + 2P}{S} \right\rfloor + 1
$$

### 8.3 Backpropagation Through Convolution

Gradient with respect to input:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial X} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial Y} * K^{rot180}
$$

Gradient with respect to kernel:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial K} = X * \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial Y}
$$

## 9. Recurrent Layers

### 9.1 Simple RNN

$$
h_t = \tanh(W_{hh} h_{t-1} + W_{xh} x_t + b_h)
$$

$$
y_t = W_{hy} h_t + b_y
$$

h_t &= o_t \odot \tanh(C_t) \quad \text{(hidden state)}
\end{align}

### 9.3 GRU

r_t &= \sigma(W_r \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t]) \quad \text{(reset gate)} \\
\tilde{h}_t &= \tanh(W \cdot [r_t \odot h_{t-1}, x_t]) \\
h_t &= (1 - z_t) \odot h_{t-1} + z_t \odot \tilde{h}_t
\end{align}

## 10. Attention Mechanism

### 10.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

### 10.2 Multi-Head Attention

$$
\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \ldots, \text{head}_h)W^O
$$

where:
$$
\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)
$$

## Conclusion

Backpropagation enables efficient gradient computation in neural networks by applying the chain rule systematically from output to input layers. Combined with optimization algorithms like Adam and regularization techniques, it forms the foundation of modern deep learning.

r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
$$

Or equivalently:
$$
r = \frac{n\sum x_i y_i - \sum x_i \sum y_i}{\sqrt{n\sum x_i^2 - (\sum x_i)^2}\sqrt{n\sum y_i^2 - (\sum y_i)^2}}
$$

### 6.2 Spearman Rank Correlation

$$
\rho = 1 - \frac{6\sum d_i^2}{n(n^2-1)}
$$

where $d_i = \text{rank}(x_i) - \text{rank}(y_i)$

---

## 7. Bayesian Statistics

### 7.1 Bayes' Theorem

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

For continuous parameters:
$$
p(\theta|x) = \frac{p(x|\theta) \cdot p(\theta)}{p(x)} = \frac{p(x|\theta) \cdot p(\theta)}{\int p(x|\theta) p(\theta) d\theta}
$$

### 7.2 Posterior Predictive Distribution

$$
p(\tilde{x}|x) = \int p(\tilde{x}|\theta) p(\theta|x) d\theta
$$

---

## 8. Maximum Likelihood Estimation

### 8.1 Likelihood Function

$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i|\theta)
$$

### 8.2 Log-Likelihood

$$
\ell(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log f(x_i|\theta)
$$

### 8.3 MLE Condition

$$
\frac{\partial \ell(\theta)}{\partial \theta} = 0
$$

### 8.4 Fisher Information

$$
I(\theta) = -\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{\partial^2 \ell(\theta)}{\partial \theta^2}\right]
$$

Cramér-Rao Lower Bound:
$$
\text{Var}(\hat{\theta}) \geq \frac{1}{n \cdot I(\theta)}
$$
