# Changelog

All notable changes to the Advanced Markdown Chunker plugin will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.2-a0] - 2024-12-05

### Major Redesign
This release is a complete architectural redesign focused on simplification and reliability.

### Changed
- **Architecture**: Renamed module from `markdown_chunker` to `markdown_chunker_v2`
- **Strategies**: Reduced from 6 strategies to 3 (code_aware, structural, fallback)
- **Configuration**: Simplified from 32 parameters to 8 core parameters
- **Types**: Consolidated all types into single `types.py` module
- **Tests**: Focused test suite reduced from 1366+ to 445 property-based tests

### Removed
- Legacy strategies: Mixed, List, Table, Sentences (functionality merged into remaining 3)
- Removed 24 configuration parameters that were rarely used or always enabled
- Removed legacy test files for removed functionality
- Removed complex fallback hierarchy (now automatic)

### Added
- `ChunkConfig.from_dict()` and `to_dict()` for serialization
- `ChunkConfig.from_legacy()` for migration from old parameters
- Simplified configuration profiles: `default()`, `for_code_heavy()`, `for_structured()`, `minimal()`

### Migration
See [docs/MIGRATION.md](docs/MIGRATION.md) for migration guide from v1.x.

## [2.0.0-a3] - 2024-12-03

### Added
- Regression and duplication validation to improve chunking reliability
- Comprehensive API reference documentation
- Block-based chunking implementation for markdown content
- Documentation for block overlap management system
- Type annotations for variable declarations

### Changed

- Overlap model now uses `previous_content` and `next_content` for metadata-based handling
- Improved overlap content extraction to include paragraphs, not just headers
- Documentation structure reorganized and updated
- API reference documentation reformatted and updated

### Fixed
- Improved strategy selection and content validation
- Enhanced packaging script and updated plugin version
- Overlap handling now properly manages neighbor context

### Refactor
- Renamed error collector classes for clarity in parser module
- Removed block-based chunking implementation reference
- Redesigned overlap handling with metadata-based mode

### Documentation
- Added detailed documentation for block overlap management system
- Updated overlap manager documentation for metadata-based mode
- Comprehensive documentation and configuration files updated
- API reference documentation completely revised
- Development guide translated to English

## [2.0.0-a0-3] - 2025-11-23

### Changed
- **Optimization:** Filtered metadata to include only RAG-useful fields
  - Removed statistical fields (avg_line_length, char_count, word_count, etc.)
  - Removed count fields (item_count, nested_item_count, etc.)
  - Removed internal execution fields (execution_fallback_level, strategy, etc.)
  - Kept semantic fields useful for retrieval (content_type, has_code, has_urls, etc.)
  - **Boolean fields optimization:** `is_*` and `has_*` fields now included only when `true`
  - Reduced metadata size by ~70% while keeping search-relevant information

### Added
- **Tests:** Added 9 unit tests for metadata filtering (`test_metadata_filtering.py`)
  - Tests for statistical field exclusion
  - Tests for boolean field optimization (only true values)
  - Tests for semantic field preservation
  - Tests for preamble handling
  - Realistic example test with actual metadata structure

## [2.0.0-a0-2] - 2025-11-23

### Fixed
- **Critical:** Fixed UI crash in Dify knowledge pipeline
  - Changed output format from array of objects to array of strings
  - Metadata now embedded in string format: `<metadata>\n{json}\n</metadata>\n{content}`
  - Compatible with Dify UI expectations for knowledge pipeline
  - Prevents React error #31 (objects not valid as React child)

## [2.0.0-a0-1] - 2025-11-23

### Fixed
- **Critical:** Fixed runtime error in tool implementation
  - Changed `chunk_overlap` parameter to `overlap_size` in ChunkConfig initialization
  - Removed non-existent parameters `strategy_override` and `include_metadata` from ChunkConfig
  - Fixed strategy and metadata handling to use chunk() method parameters instead
  - Tool now correctly processes documents without errors

## [2.0.0-a0-0] - 2025-11-23

### Fixed
- **Critical:** Fixed icon path in manifest.yaml causing import errors
  - Changed `icon: _assets/icon.svg` to `icon: icon.svg` in all YAML files
  - This aligns with Dify's convention where icons are automatically resolved from `_assets/` directory
  - Verified against official Dify plugins
- **Critical:** Fixed tags validation
  - Changed from custom tags (`rag`, `chunking`, `markdown`, `knowledge-base`) to standard tags (`productivity`, `business`)
  - CLI validates tags against standard list
- **Build:** Fixed packaging to use official dify-plugin CLI
  - Replaced manual packaging script with official CLI
  - Created `.difyignore` to exclude `venv/`, tests, and development files from package
  - Package now passes all CLI validations

### Changed
- Updated `make package` to use official dify-plugin CLI
- Updated tests to match new icon path and tag requirements
- Cleaned up temporary documentation files
- Consolidated documentation into core files

### Package
- **Format:** `dify-markdown-chunker-official-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.difypkg`
- **Size:** 136 KB (compressed), ~550 KB (uncompressed)
- **Files:** 52 files (core functionality + essential docs)
- **Status:** ✅ Production ready - UI compatible

### Documentation
- Added `DEVELOPMENT.md` - comprehensive development guide
- Updated `README.md` - streamlined with references to other docs
- Updated `INSTALLATION.md` - installation instructions
- Updated `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - common issues and solutions
- Updated `PACKAGING.md` - packaging instructions

### Technical Details
- Analyzed official Dify plugins to understand correct format
- Confirmed that Dify automatically searches for icons in `_assets/` directory
- **Important:** CLI supports `.difyignore` file for excluding files from package
- `.gitignore` only affects git repository, `.difyignore` affects package contents
- Package size: 145 KB (compressed), 575 KB (uncompressed)
- Maximum package size: 50 MB (uncompressed)
- Excluded from package: tests, development docs, validation scripts, Python cache

### Migration Notes
If you have an older version installed:
1. Uninstall the old version from Dify UI
2. Install the new package from releases
3. Reconfigure any Knowledge Bases using the plugin
